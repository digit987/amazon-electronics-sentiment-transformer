"Your mileage may vary; it will depend on how picky you are about sound quality.This device is easy to get working; I didn't even have to put in a pin to pair it with my tablet. However, the problem is with the audio quality. I am not an audiophile but I do like the audio to be clear. I tried this device on a few different speaker systems and all had a noticeable drop in quality. The sounds become ""muddy""; highs were not as clear and mid tones blend into the bass. Using my tablet or Smartphone via Bluetooth to my car receiver works famously, so it is unfortunate that I can't use this device in-home for the same purpose.  The loss in quality was obvious and distracting so I applied for a return the same night.",0,0,0.6936382,0.29467812,0.011683691
"RUN do not walk to any other tablet that has gorilla glass and not regular glass.  I bought my son a Toshiba Thrive for Christmas 2011.  He was just in love. Bought a case: Bought screen protectors: and has taken care of his ""baby"".  I've never seen someone so excited even months later by his toy.  This morning he picked it up and the glass just cracked. I heard it from across the room.  We can not figure out why.  I can only assume that the glass had hairline fractures prior to assembly and over time the stress of the picking up the tablet has caused the glass to stress to the point of fracture.  The cost for a replacement screen and frame assembly $160.00. (NO LABOR)  That's right almost 1/2 the cost of the tablet  WHAT!!!! That says two things:  #1 - Toshiba knew the glass would break and saw a way to make more profit.  #2 -  they won't stand behind the broken screen under their warranty (assumption is that broken glass must be the owner fault).  If you search the internet you will find numerous complaints about the broken screen.  The unit works fine if you want to risk cutting your finger!!!!  Personally I think Toshiba should ""MAN UP"" and cover any screen that has broken under the warranty...Toshiba is now officially on the list of companies to avoid.",0,0,0.70597607,0.16571866,0.12830529

"The NextBook3 is not a cheap version of the iPad. You must remember that this gadget is just a book reader with extra features. If you want a book reader with a few extras like good color, wi-fi, picture storage, a video player and a music player, then this one's for you. It is very basic.If you plan on searching the web, using various apps, playing games and easily maneuvering from page to page, then you should save your money for a better tablet. This tablet has so many glitches that I rarely use it for anything other than viewing pictures.PROS:1.) I use the NextBook3 mainly to view photos and it displays the pictures nicely.2.) You can add up to 8 GB of space by using an SD card.3.) The screen size is nice - larger than the 7"" and smaller than the iPad.4.) Light-weight5.) Transfers data easily via a USB cable connected to the computer.6.) Wi-Fi7.) Plays great looking videos via your SD card.CONS:1.) The touch screen is horrible. You have to constantly press items over and over to select them. When you try to scroll, it keeps selecting items instead.2.) You can download apps from the Amazon store with no problem, but the NextBook3 can't/won't install 90% of them.3.) The Kindle app will load, but you get constant errors when you try to read the books.4.) The Wi-Fi works, but it is weak.5.) The tablet freezes for no reason at anytime - You must constantly reset the unit.6.) The Android 2.1 in the unit needs some serious updates.7.) There are no software or firmware updates or fixes for the unit - you're stuck with the constant glitches and freezes and shortcomings of the NextBook3.8.) E-Fun's customer service is not helpful. They basically tell you that the NextBook3 is not an iPad and you're stuck with what you have.9.) The battery drains very fast. You must remember to plug it into an outlet every night to recharge it.10.) It does not recharge by connecting it to your computer via the USB cable - the cable is for transferring data only.11.) The Stand-By mode drains the battery - you have to turn it off whenever you're not using it.12.) The instructions recommend that you DO NOT use the tablet while it is recharging. (WTH???)I truly wish that I had waited and saved a few more bucks to buy a bigger and better tablet.When you cut costs, you get what you pay for.",0,2,0.01640102,0.2319467,0.7516523

Perhaps if the camcorder weighed several pounds it might might smooth out this action, but I'd never trust an expensive camera to a tripod as cheap as this. I figured I could at least keep it for a still camera but then the center tube that houses the center column also fell out of the plastic body and it would not screw back in.

"I bought this enclosure because the metal mesh sides seemed like a good way to avoid heat problems that can reduce drive life. After a week the drive stopped working, and after once again taking both sides off with their 8 slotted head screws and 4 Phillips head drive retaining screws, I confirmed that the drive and cable were both working, although the drive needed to be checked. The USB interface failed to recognize the device on two other computers, so it was clear that the electronics failed.Given how simple the interface is, it's suprising to see this happen. I can count on the thumb of one hand the number of times in the last five years that I have had an electronic device fail after a week of use. Usually it's DOA or it works for years. I have another fully enclosed USB drive that has been working for a couple of years now, so I'll get another one of those.

I have two of these. One at home and one at work. I've found them to be very finicky. A difference of an inch can change the audio levels a lot and since there is significant lag in the analog to digital conversion it is nearly impossible to monitor the levels while recording oneself. I finally gave up on these and went with a separate mic mixing board and firewire A/D converter. The quality isn't that much better but at least I can listen to myself on the headphones while I record to make sure the levels aren't changing without being .1 second out of sync.,0,1,0.21444708,0.71508217,0.07047079

No issues mounting to the camera.  The only complaint is the thickness of the screen protector is not just a film.  It is a film/sheet with a thicker silver (not black as pictured) frame that has sharp outside corners that are not rounded or friendly.

"DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO HOLD THE THING!After two days of trying to like this tablet, I decided that I've had enough.There is a real home button at the bottom, which works well. There is also a BACK button and MENU button, which don't work fine.Actually they work too fine. Because they are capacitive and not real buttons (like the home button is), just touching the bottom of the tablet almost anywhere triggers one of these buttons. The BACK button will take you back when you don't want to, and the menu button will sometimes pop up a menu, but more often pops up a search box over the entire screen.Touching the MENU button again makes the search box go away, but I've had enough. A HUGE waste of my time that makes using this tablet very frustrating. EVERY TIME I USE IT!I didn't buy the case for it initially. But I ordered some cases, so maybe holding it by the case will help?Other than that the tablet works OK. It's light and thin. The screen looks great. It's pretty fast and has a built-in GPS that works OK. The sound is pretty loud. Scrolling on the screen is smooth.But hitting one or the other capacitive buttons ...once or twice EVERY minute... while holding this thing makes it useless for me.I have a Galaxy Tab 7.0 (the original) that just didn't want to run most new programs (they aren't even offered in the play store because the tablet is so old), so I bought this tablet. The original Tab has four capacitive buttons along the bottom, but I didn't have the problem with them. You have to touch right on the actual icon.On the Tab 8 you can touch anywhere around the button. It has a bubble sound when you touch one of those ""buttons"" so you know you just screwed up.There doesn't seem to be a setting for how sensitive the button is. I don't have a samsung phone which I understand this is a copy of. Maybe it's not an issue on a phone because you normally hold it in portrait mode. I always hold a tablet in landscape mode.UPDATE: The three cases I've tried didn't help much. Samsung can fix this if they program the buttons to be less sensitive, or require that the button be touched for half a second. But they don't seem to care.This is the LAST Samsung product I'm going to buy. It is UNUSABLE if you have to hold it in your hands in landscape (portrait is essentially impossible because of the tiny edges before the screen starts, you keep touching something on the screen).If you leave it on a desk or glued to a wall, and never try to pick it up, it's OK.",0,0,0.652093,0.2589802,0.088926725

"Ok so, i got one of these from another store as my first usb drive ever, i liked it cuz of the size, it arrived in its original package and everything, and when i first used it i was copying some video files about 1.7gb divided among several small files (about 80mb each), it took a while to finish, the transfer rate was about 2.5mb per second, by that time i didn't knew if this was fast or slow since it was my first time with a usb drive of my own, then after that i started to copy another video file (about the same size and statistics as the first one).... and OMG.... the transfer rate went down to like 250KB/sec, it said: wait time 1 hour i mean 1 hour.... give me a break. then i checked about it and tryed to format it to NTFS but it was impossible, tried the direct tool, and via the command window also. nothing worked (which was SO FRUSTRATING, since each try was like hours and hours of waiting), and also tried to change the setting to better performance on the device tools. so i decided to drop it and just got a different one. i don't know if maybe my unit was just defective or something, but well.",0,2,0.23464496,0.20645821,0.5588969

"This product is a great concept and the Hardware appears to be solid BUT the software called Dataplex which interfaces the drive leaves a lot to be desired.  As expressed by other reviewers, my installation went along perfectly and the Adrenaline came on line when I rebooted.  I used it for a couple of days and enjoyed beautiful performance.  The third day I went to a meeting leaving the computer on.  When I returned there was a message on the screen saying the system had failed to boot.  I tried several things to get it running.  I could boot into my Wubi (Utuntu under Windows) with no problem but could not boot windows.  A screen showing up on booting the Adrenaline gave me the opportunity to disable it, which I did.  That didn't help.  Using various tools I found that the hard drive no longer recognized the system partition.  It did recognize the system restore partition (unfortunately that was the original Vista distribution).  After some research I found EaseUS Partition Recovery, a free download on CNet.com.  That software was able to restore the partition.  I chose not to attempt to run that drive after all it went through and restored my April Backup on a new drive and moved the data from the original drive using a BlackX  eSata to Usb docking station ( [...] ) into which I could plug my old internal drive.My caution to you is that this product is not for the faint of heart.

"Purchased this player looking for a low-cost and easy to use Media Player for my family to use.  Primarily for home movies recorded from HD cameras, etc.  Upon opening the box I realized that the unit was very, very light, much lighter than say a Patriot Home Box Office.  It had the feel of a very cheap piece of electronics, even the buttons were not well made.  After purchasing about 4 or 5 other Media Players in the past I expected to see an HDMI cable in the box, but was sad to find nothing.  The only cable in the box was a HORRIBLE single pin connection to the unit that provided Composite (Red/White/Yellow).  This was the worst audio/video connection and quality that I've ever seen in a Media Player.  When I plugged it into the unit it would create static and would only come out in one channel unless I pulled it out and pushed it in over and over again.  Finally after a ton of tries, I got it to play in ""stereo"" for about a minute, but was horrified to see the picture quality.  The picture quality through the factory cable was un-watchable.. was grainy and fuzzy on the HD TV.Decided that I had to go to the store and pickup an HDMI cable.  Upon returning and attaching the cable, I removed the crap cable and then switched the TV to the HDMI input.  Turned the Micca on and ... nothing.  TV reported an HDMI connection error.  I swore and then started hitting the stupid TV button on the remote which was supposed to change the settings for (480p, 720p, etc.).  After about 30 minutes I went online and discovered that there were many people that had a defective box with a bad HDMI connection.  So... back to the store again I went and decided to get a Composite Cable and was going to use it in conjunction with the crappy audio connect that came in the box.  Upon returning I sadly found out that you HAVE to use the optical audio out when using Composite, no analog out available...I gave up, this thing needs to go back to wherever hole it crawled out of and become a toaster or something useful.  Very disappointed and will not buy anything Micca again.",0,0,0.98085034,0.01683206,0.0023176197

I don't know for sure whether it was broken when I got it or if it was broken during the course of initial setup. I suspect it actually broke as I was plugging in the cables and positioning the hub; while I didn't baby it, I wasn't rough either.After unpacking it, I plugged 2 Western Digital USB 3.0 3-TB drives into it using their USB 3.0 cables. I plugged the hub into my computer using the USB 3.0 cable it came with, which has that USB 3-style thin flat tight connector on the hub end. I hooked up the power supply. None of the devices were seen in Windows, no lights on the hub except power. Long story short, the thin flat port on the hub side, in which you plug the PC connection cable, was loose internally.

"The HD555 claims to be designed for watching movies, with its ""sound channeling"" feature. But it comes with a 1/4"" plug, which no modern television has. Modern televisions -- along with iPods and almost everything else that has a headphones jack -- have 3.5mm jacks. 1/4"" jacks are only found on full-size receivers. I have two televisions, both on the popular Cheetah wall mounts. Cheetah designs its mounts with 3"" of space for plugs. Most plugs are 1-2"" long so this is plenty of room. But the Sennheiser 1/4"" plug with its included 1/4""-to-3.5mm adapter is 4"" long -- too big to fit. The plug is as big as my iPhone, and far bigger than my iPod shuffle. Even if you have plenty of space behind your television (or iPod) the 4"" plug sooner or later will get knocked or catch on your sleeve or something, and a 4"" plug has a lot of leverage to break a jack. Sennheiser could have made the headphones with the common 3.5mm plug and included a 3.5mm-to-1/4"" adapter. This would have fit everything and prevented broken jacks.",0,2,0.054741133,0.19506314,0.7501957

"After all the hype about the Polk XRt12 I was expecting the sound quality from this unit to be nothing short of astonishing. I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed. While it was a breeze to hook up via optical cable to my Harman/Kardon AVR110 and it was simple to aim the antenna (according to the ""antenna aiming signal strength indicator"" I had a perfect signal) it has the same quality as my Delphi SkyFi unit that it replaces. I can't hear any difference between the two. Even with side by side comparison (Polk XRt12 vs. Delphi Skyfi) they sound the same. I wouldn't recommend buying this to replace any exisiting home unit. If you already have XM at home, the signal sounds just as good with what you already have. With all the compression involved in beaming the XM signals to earth, there's only so much any device can extract.

Turns out, it was.I was hoping that the state of the technology had increased enough to make this common component inexpensive to produce.  Well, it is cheap.  And it shows.After four months of very light use, the player stopped reading DVDs.  Of course the labor warranty ran out after three months.So I visited Sony's support site.  I entered my info and was pleased to see that this unit is covered under an exchange program.  Great, I thought.  The company found that this model is defective and will give me a new one.Well, they will give me a refurbished model if I pay to ship it to them and send them a check for $33 to cover the labor to repair the unit.No thanks.

"I had the Tab Pro 8.4, but Itched to get the new Tab S 8.4. I have to say I am very disappointed.Laggy, more bloat, no Knox app1. Screen - as with most, or all other super amoled displays, this unit's display is problematic in the sense that it is pinkish (based on my own personal experience, which some people also complained about in forums), just like my Note 2! S4! and Note 3! Yes I am an Upgradeholic, and I suffer from Upgradeitis... on my handsets that I mentioned, they all had pinkish displays, and they all had darker bottom half, specially the S4 which I had replaced  under warranty because it was so annoying especially at night when I am reading. The Tab Pro 8.4 does not have this problem.2. Memory (RAM) - I thought the 3gb was good on the Tab S, but the unit is preinstalled with more bloatwarez than the Tab pro, and what makes it worse is these bloatwarez cannot be stopped from running so they occupy a lot of the memory and running in the background unnecessarily. Waste of memory space and battery.3. Processor - Maybe this contributes to the lag on the Tab S, because the octacore is not yet properly implemented maybe, can't really comment on this, but I don't trust Exynos. They caused problems on the earlier Galaxy S3 and Note 2 where the phone has random reboots then eventually shuts down and won't turn back on within the first six months of use!...  google up S3 or Note 2 Sudden Death Syndrome  so you will know what I am talking about. This happened to my previous phones, and I consider myself the luckiest bastard in the gadget world.4. Knox - I have used knox on my Tab Pro 8.4 and I like the security because I use my tablet when travelling, but the Knox container is not included with the Tab S, but they somehiw replaced it with more bloatware.5. Build/size - the Tab Pro 8.4 is a little bigger, but the fake faux leather finish is better than the plasticky band aid like back of the Tab S. They are both plastic but fantastic! Both very light but the Tab S is even lighter.6. ROOT - if you do not know about this, then just ignore it. This is for people who do habitually do it to their phones/tablets to boost performance. I am not planning to root my Tab Pro 8.4 because it is not that bloated and runs smooth unlike the Tab S. I also don't want to loose Knox...Now, if you plan to root your device, then you can potentially make the Tab S run smoother by debloating it, tweak processor speed, etc, but be aware that exynos chip is not as widely supported as the chip on the Tab pro which means no or limited Ready cooked ROMs from developers.To those who have the Tab Pro 8.4, you are lucky to have it instead of the Tab S 8.4, you are really not missing out. To those who want to buy either unit, it's your decision to make, but you have been warned...Good luck!=========Edit:Here is how I check my devices' screen.1. Go to playstore and download Dead Pixel Detect and Fix by Chaming Studio2. Go to a dark room and open the app.3. On the bottom of the app, clock the ""colors"" tab and a new pop up window will open, choose each color and carefully check for dots/pixels that are not the same color with the current displayed color. Black is a dead pixel which cannot be repaired, while other colored pixels like white, are stuck pixels and may be repaired.4. Now on the darker half screen that I mention, choose ""white"" or ""grey"" color and look for variances on your screen. Some have pinkish tint, while others have yellowish tint... goodluck!=======Edit: it looks like some people got butthurt because of my review, well let me say the Tab S 8.4 is a tad smaller and lighter which I like,and I like the new style keyboard on it (it looks like the keyboard of the LG Tablets.",0,0,0.83289057,0.16004191,0.0070675244

There always seemed to be a slight millisecond lag between when you move the mouse and when the cursor moves on the screen.

"After using the ""Gunnar Optiks Catalyst Edge Digital Performance Eyewear"" (man, what a name) for almost a solid week I feel like I can write this review ... and it's not particularly glowing.First, these glasses are designed to eliminate eye strain by limiting your eyes' exposure to the bright light coming from your computer screen (this is done by using tinted lenses) and make it easier to read what is on the screen (done by optical correction ... sort of like over-the-counter reading glasses). If this is what you need to be comfortable while using the computer then these glasses might be perfect for you.Unfortunately, using these glasses didn't help me at all. In fact, rather than reduce eye strain I suffered from increased eye strain and a sense of nausea that almost felt like motion sickness when I was using these glasses. Because of the corrective lenses my eyes were thrown out of their usual focus and I could literally feel my eyes staining to compensate for the magnification caused by the glasses. This is exactly the opposite thing you want from glasses designed to reduce eye strain.I can say that the tinted lenses did make the computer screens I use look less bright, but I could resolve that simply by turning down the brightness on my computer screen ... or wear a pair of sunglasses indoors.Bottom line, these glasses might help some people to reduce eye strain while using a computer, but if you're like me then these glasses will have the opposite effect.",0,1,0.20265523,0.718721,0.07862383

"Oh man, these are trash. I picked up a pair at the local drugstore on a radical discount, just to see. They were so far out of alignment that even when I could get the images to merge, convex objects looked concave. Guaranteed to induce headaches. Then there's the mushy focusing, and the chromatic aberration on bright objects. Finally, the view is noticeably dimmer than in my 7x35s, which shouldn't happen with double the light-gathering area on the objective lenses (pi*35*35=3846 square mm; pi*50*50=7850 square mm). My guess is that the manufacturer should have passed on the ""UV coating"" and added some coatings to enhance light transmission, like you find on decent binoculars.

"Purchased the H100 for a new gaming rig. Installed everything fine, did quick power/system checks before actually installing the OS etc and the cooler seemed to work fine while the case was on it's side (Corsair 800D). Once everything was up and running, the pump started to make a very loud grinding noise and could be heard over 4 120mm fans (case + radiator) and 1x 140mm exhaust fan. Searched the web for answers and found that tapping the plastic tubing or the fan controller/pump block would occasionally stop the problem. I requested an exchange with Amazon, new unit arrived in 3-4 days; removed the previously installed H100, cleaned up my cpu and installed the new one. Powered up my system and sure enough, out of the box, this H100 unit was defective as well. The grinding noise in the new unit was even worse. I could not stand the noise coming out of that pump, I was ready to purchase a normal Air cpu heatsink or another Liquid cooler from Intel or Antec.At my local Fry's, I decided on a Antec 920 Khuler with a much smaller radiator + x2 120mm fans and could not be happier...so much more quiet, rubber tubing, slick look and customizable LED on the unit + software for fan control. While browsing for a new replacement, I noticed about 6-8 H100 and other Hydro series liquid coolers with return stickers on them probably with the same pump problem.Save yourself the headache and money, stay away from this unit.Also - on the installation for H100, I noticed the the screws provided are too long and bend the radiator fins when installing your fans.",0,2,0.11967918,0.07072701,0.8095938
"I was delighted when I saw that this device completely eliminated all noise while I was charging my iPOD with my car charger. My car radio came with a ""pig tail"" MP3 cord. The first problem I had was that I could not fit the Kensington plug into the pig tail. I have used this pig tail with several MP3 cords and never had a problem. So I finally took two pliers and jammed the plug in. Next, I plugged the cord into my iPOD. It fit OK, but it was exasperatingly intermittent where the right side stereo would stop working unless I wiggled the Kensington plug. Again, I have never had this kind of problem with several other MP3 cords. Next, in an attempt to fix the problem, I bought a connector with two female ends. I plugged in a regular MP3 cord into the pig tail. Then I plugged the other end of the regular cord into this female connector. Then I plugged the Kensington into the other end of the female connector. The right audio still cut out intermittently. If I bent the Kensington plug at this female connector to the left, one side of the stereo would stop working and if I bent it to the right, it would be OK, So I tried to super glue the Kensington plug at the connector in the position where everything would work; but after the glue dried, I found the connection was STILL intermittent. I threw the Kensington cord in the garbage. I lost my money, but think of all the nut doctor cost I saved by getting rid of this thing. UPDATE: At the last minute, I retrieved this infernal device from the trash and cut both plugs off with diagonal cutters and threw them away.  Then I went to RadioShack and bought a plain shielded cable and cut the plugs off of them as well.  Then I connected the good plugs to the Kensington wire by using ""Telephone Butt Connectors +26-22 gauge"".  I had a crimping tool and I used these butt connectors instead of soldering the wires.  This project took an hour. There are six wires total that need to be connected - three per plug.  The result was absolute perfection.  I can only speak for my application and my experience.  I use the Kensington whenever I charge my iPOD with my car charger.  It not only reduced the whine and buzz, but it absolutely eliminated ALL of the noise.  It ABLULUTELY had zero negative effect on the audio sound quality - it was clear as a bell - no different than when I was not using the charger.  So, would I buy this product again? Yes. I could find no other brand of this type of device out there.",0,2,0.19996947,0.3396813,0.46034923

"The other reviews here essentially cover the important parts. I'll note a few specifics here: My camera functioned fine out of the box and still works today (about a year later), but only via a wired Ethernet connection. My local Wifi is WPA2-TKIP (note that I don't have AES, just a pre-shared key), via an Actiontec router that's bone-stock (no custom firmware or special configurations). I've tried to contact Foscam many times over the past year, all to no avail. I've decided that this camera is simply a wired-only piece of hardware, which happens to be fine with me. However, that means this product is clearly and continually mislabeled since it doesn't really have a complete Wifi adapter (I say ""complete"" because it may work just fine with other network security types, but it does not work with WPA2-TKIP, which I find quite common these days).The physical build quality and firmware quality is terrible, like all poor Chinese knockoffs: there are clear language failures, the UI is terrible, and the molded plastic parts are inferior to anything but other Chinese products I've purchased.I'm not quite sure why PTZ webcams are still so expensive these days. Unfortunately this camera is actually an ok gamble at $85 if you want something with medium picture quality, poor build quality (I hope you don't need to move it much), and wired-only operation.Also, here's the current direct download link for Foscam firmware: [...]",0,0,0.80962586,0.15811168,0.032262422

"I enjoy taking digital photos of people and places, and thought I was moving up to the next level when I bought this camera, but it has been a disappointment in so many ways.I ""upgraded"" to this Canon from an older Canon 3MP point-and-shoot, which was (and remains) the best camera I ever owned.  I took the A560 with me on its ""maiden voyage"" to NYC and snapped hundreds of photos in very different lighting conditions (in daylight, in shadows and at dusk, and at night).  The pictures were bright and colorful on the viewfinder, but when I got home I discovered two things.  One, all of the pictures had VERY poor contrast, on screen and when printed.  Two, the image sensor had bad pixels right in the middle of the sensor!  I should have sent the camera back, but I put my camera away after the trip and forgot about it for a couple months.The next time I needed to take pictures I got out my A560 and discovered the batteries were dead.  No problem, I put in another set of batteries and took pictures of some things I wanted to sell.  I put the camera away, with brand new Duracell batteries in tow, and let it set for another couple months.  Next time I needed to take pictures I found the batteries were dead again.  The camera was sitting in a drawer in my desk at home, at room temperature, the whole time, so why on earth did the camera run them out?  I have since proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that this is a problem with this camera, after wasting a dozen or so pairs of perfectly good batteries.The last straw for me was when the camera stopped recognizing fully charged rechargeable batteries as charged.  I stopped putting regular batteries in this camera because I knew it would waste them, and this morning I put in a set of NiMH AA's right out of my charger, only to find the Canon thought they were ""dead"".  I grabbed another pair, straight from the charger.  Dead.  I got out my voltmeter and measured the batteries.  1.3V right on the money.  I took the batteries and the memory card out of the camera and threw the thing in the trash.  That's it for me!In summary, this camera takes bland photos and wastes batteries.  The bad pixels, poor image contrast and constant problems with the batteries make it more trouble than it's worth.

I purchased this device for myself in 2011. It has worked perfectly and will hold a charge up to a month. Recently I purchased another one for my fiance in Manila Philippines. I regret not testing it prior to sending. The device charges fully in about 15 minutes and the charge only lasts about an hour of continuous use. My fiance lives in a brand new luxury high rise with stable western style electricity so that variable is ruled out. I suspect it was a return that was repackaged.My advice is plug it in immediately and assess its ability to hold the charge. It should take about an hour fully depleted to charge up. When fully charged it should last at least 6 hours.Shipping the item back to me from Manila would cost more than the device itself so I am unable to return it.,0,0,0.5524623,0.26931468,0.17822304

"I use my iPod primarily for audiobooks. I thought this would be a great replacement for my broken iPod classic. What a mistake! The nano LOOKS awesome and appears slick and modern, but I found the touchscreen very difficult to use with my fingers and it did not handle audiobooks that well.First, the setup. Like most iPod's transferring books and media is easy. You just plug it into a machine running iTunes and it syncs up. Sound quality was good.Now, the bad news. After I hooked it up and began stroll I selected an audiobook and went walking. The interface for listening to audiobooks is not user friendly. The audiobooks show up in 'chapter' form, rather than as a continuous book I can fast forward and reverse through. There is a way to access a mini view of the classic ff/rew feature, however, it is too tiny. Annoying. Further, the touchscreen buttons to fast forward and reverse and pause are too close to the buttons for volume control and are easily clicked by mistake. It is tough to use the buttons without a stylus, which I refuse to use while hiking. For some inexplicable reason, the iPod would lose my place in the book, and finding it again, by using the reverse and fast forward feature took too much time. The battery drains quickly, and I was disappointed to notice that after less than an hour of use it had drained a lot of it's juice. Finally, the touch screen interface is not customizable, and somewhat redundant. There is both a touchscreen volume control and a manual volume control. I would prefer one or the other.I returned mine to Target for a refund, and the clerk was not surprised, he said it was a piece of junk.

"UPDATE 9/18/13: Shortly after this review, more than half of my usb ports stopped working and I was unable to access the uefi. I contacted TigerDirect customer service about getting a return on the defective board. Sadly, my thirty days were up, and the only way they would honor a return would be if I bought another Asus board from them and paid for a 2-3 year warranty. Out of options, I decided to grab the Asus Sabertooth 990FX R2.0. When I first installed the Sabertooth I was very concerned it would be just as bad as the M5a99fx (At least I'd be able to complain about it for the next 2 years, as I purchased a 2 year warranty) , but I was actually blown away by the ability of this board. I am now able to get a 100 percent stable overclock at 4.8Ghz on 1.44V and a gaming overclock of 5.0Ghz.I would highly recommend the Sabertooth, as it is completely worth the extra 50 bucks.Original Review:I purchased this board a little over a month ago from TigerDirect and can say I have been everything but pleased with this board.Right out of the box, the board produced a small cloud of smoke. I double and triple checked all my cabling, and was confident everything was plugged in correctly. I restarted the computer, and did not see any smoke.Under Prime95, I get socket temps of 60C with no overclock, and am hitting 75C with my FX-8350 at 4.4Ghz. This is upsetting because my core temps do not pass  45C. Meaning that the board is whats holding me back from any further OCing. (These results were gathered in my bedroom, with window open [so good airflow] at 70F). Also, my case is a NZXT Phantom Full Tower, which has exceptional cooling as well.Also, I tried the TurboV EVO auto overclock and it put my 8350 at 4.4Ghz on 1.4V. Now, if I try to even increase my speed to 4.5Ghz, I have to keep upping the voltage until I reach around 1.48V to run prime95 without cores failing instantly. This, as you can guess, runs extremely hot and I cannot even run prime95 for more than a minute before I get concerned about temperatures. Even though this may be CPU related, I still feel that the motherboard has a part to play in it.So to sum everything up into one sentence, it would be: ""The color is nice. That's it"".

"I bought a set of these 32GB microSD cards back in November 2012. One was for my phone and the other my tablet.The first problem I encountered was that when I checked to see how much free space I had and expected to see the full 32GB I had paid for, I saw 29GB instead. This freaked me out until I talked to a friend of mine who assured me this was normal. &#34;Normal&#34; I asked him. After some added research, it turns out he was right. Memory manufacturers use 1,000 bites as the standard, instead of the actual 1,024 bites that make up a KB, and so on. This makes it so that when you get to GB or larger you get significantly less space that is advertised.The second problem is that only 6 months after I bought them, one of the cards stopped working. The second one took 3 more months but it also quit working. They would simply not be recognized by my devices and read as corrupted. This is very interesting seeing as they where just sitting in my phone and tablet, not being used very much at all. In fact I have a 16GB microSD that I bought in 2011, and its still working perfectly with heavy repeated use (it is also a SanDisk microSD).

You have to remove the tablet from the case to fold the stand up, and it's not secured in that position in any way; it just sits against a small ridge meaning it can easily be jostled loose.* The handle on the back is mostly useless, given that the flap its attached to isn't secured on the back side of the tablet when in the open position.

Wow I'm really impressed with this cable. I needed a long cable to charge my galaxy S3. But this is the mother of all usb cables. It's literally twice as thick as the charging cable that came with my phone. It actually fits a little more snug in my phone too. And plenty of length as well.This is like the equivalent of a monster HDMI Cable as far as quality.A lot of people were complaining about the poor quality of cables when I did a search for Samsung a.c.  charger. So I just searched for usb. Cables. Glad I did.EDIT: Horrible cables!!!  As you can tell from this review i thought these cables were amazing when i first bought them. one stopped working  after just a couple months. Ithought it was a fluke. But then shortly after that Iwent to plug my phone in at work and it wouldnt charge. I had my fiance bring by a old OEM cable to the fire station and problem solved. phone started charging. THese cables ended up in the trash. I bought some cheap looking ones on amazon to replace these and they have been working fine ever since. very disapointed. Ive never changed a review on amazon before. These went from 5 star to 1 star.,0,2,0.07364961,0.0805734,0.845777

"This is sad but I cannot give this product any rating higher than 2 stars, it failed on me too many times that I had to return it.Keep in mind that I used the camera with a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, 3 and an iPhone 5.First let me talk about syncing and first time use:1. Download and install app via app store or playstore2. Turn camera on and make sure to make it discoverable so that your device may scan for it3. Make sure your device is on same wifi network as the camera (it has its own wifi address so connect to that, Android with NFC makes this hassle free)4. Type annoying pw that is found on one the tags of the camera (your supposed to type it once only but I had to do it numerous times after exiting the app and shutting the camera off)5. Carefully snap on to your device and test it out.Overall the process is supposed to be simple but you may run into problems with scanning, connecting and disconnecting oh and LAG lots of lag.I noticed that the camera works better with an Android device since the iPhone had trouble scanning for the camera wifi network as well as automatically connecting when powered on. The android did a much better job at scanning and connecting.There's a bit of lag (depends on your device) when taking photos, aiming at your subject(s) and connecting. It gets frustrating really fast that you end up using the camera app on your device.For some reason my iPhone tended to drop connection compared to my Android devices (the NFC really helps).There are two ways to take a photo, you can use the physical button located on the side of the camera or you can use the sony app. Just make sure that the subject you are taking a picture of is not moving otherwise the lag will give you a nice blurry photo.The zoom feature is actually pretty nice but also lags (there is too much lag between communication of the sony software and the camera).There is no flash so make sure you have plenty of light source otherwise you will get some very dark photos.Photo quality varies (light source) and while the photos are not that bad, I found most to be washed out, over saturated, unbalanced tones and a bit noisy (not as clear as I hoped). I only got a few shots that I actually liked and this was probably due to the light source. I should also note that most of my photos were taken outside, quality improved indoors in a well lit room.I am not a pro so I cannot provide a more detailed review on photo quality.Design wise the camera looks very very nice too bad it feels cheap real cheap. I had the white colored QX10 which looks GREAT on the new iPhone 5s gold (temporarily borrowed from a friend to see how it looked).Software is like any other camera app but you cannot save to an SD card for some reason. You can immediately share to Instagram or another photo social sharing app but that was never my intention to begin with. Software did not play nicely with the iPhone 5 so just focused on using Android.A pro of the QX10 is that it fits most phones even phablets, just do not use a case.I had trouble reconnecting my devices to the camera each time I turned it off. Sometimes the device would see the camera and automatically connect to it but most of the time I had to go through the entire set up all over again. Not worth the hassle.I gave it two days and decided to return it.Interestingly enough I was at a sony retail store and was able to play with the QX100 which was more stable and syncing worked as advertised. Photo quality was impressive and there was less lag. But the price tag was not worth it and I never really saw myself using this camera on a daily basis to justify the price tag.This camera is suited more toward hobbyist, not even your average consumer will use it too much due to the hassle of turning it on, waiting for it to connect and launching the app.My experience was a poor one but yours may be different and pleasant so ultimately decide are you the type that will use the camera on a daily basis that justifies the price or are you an impulse buyer that wants to add another unnecessary accessory to your tech collection. If that latter, do not buy since it will just gather dust.",0,0,0.8644166,0.11635325,0.019230114

"Pros: No GlareCons:no application instructions (and application is not the same as other screen protectors I've applied)Matte finish is very grainy.Not a perfect fitFirst off, I opened the package to look for instructions and none were to be found (in or on the package). Every other screen protector I've ever installed had 3 layers (prior to application), one that you take off before you ever start applying it, and another that you take off after you are done. Perhaps this is related to it being a matte finish and not picking up fingerprints, I'm not sure, but it threw me off.I had the screen protector about halfway on before I realized this and had to reset what I was doing.  In trying to get it on there is no real lining it up, because the screen protector is actually a bit small for the device (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7"") and doesn't completely cover the screen.While the matte finish does do a good job at deterring glare, it is very grainy making it difficult to really see clearly through.

"Purchased and received it, however it sat for a month before I had time to play with it.  Added four 500GB RE drives.  Plugged in the USB and hit power... Nada, nothing, not even the something is there but no driver errors. So I tried the eSATA. Again, nothing.

"Let me start by saying this is a great starter camera and for someone like me who is n a budget it isn't bad.  shoots great and the 1080p 60fps is a very nice feature in a DSLR for this price.  The main reason I have to rate this so low is the fact that nikon still hasn't fixed the aperture problem.  I shoot video so it would be nice to be able to adjust aperture while in live view rather than having to exit, change, and then reenter in order to view it.  Canon has had the real time aperture change in live view for quite sometime.  for those wondering,  the reason for this is actually in the mechanics.  Cannon has the functions built into the lens which allow this... nikon needs to hurry up and figure out a way to do this as it is a problem with not only this camera but other more professional models as well.  If you are using this for photography and won't use a lot of video then this will be fine.If you are shooting video don't count this out just yet.  I have used both the nikon d3300 and the cannon t3i  and I feel the overal image quality to be better on the d3300.  Also, the d3300 is a lot smaller and lighter.

"This is a great Mobo, I am very impressed with it's performance, but that's what I have come to expect from all ASUS products.  Every aspect of this Mobo is constructed using the best materials and workmanship, much stiffer that most other Mobo's, with the weight of the better CPU cooling sinks and and fans, this board supported the weight with only one screw into the box, a drastic improvement over all past Mobo's I have ever owned.This is a 5 star product, but there is a big discrepancy between the image shown and the fact that it does NOT include the Thunderbolt card (which is well over $150 to purchase separate)?  I can understand that sellers share images on products, but NOT with a $300 MOBO. When you have finally waded through all the various makes and models and sockets, you would think that this ~$300 item would warrant a correct image.  Primarily because it would be VERY easy to NOT catch that this did not have the thunderbolt card (there is no mention of it's inclusion or exclusion and the only thing you have to go with is the image, nothing else mentions the TB card). Just because it never says anywhere that it does NOT have the card shown on the image, doesn't mean that one would assume that it would not be included.  I thought that this Mobo had the thunderbolt card and that there was only one model of this Mobo (from the Amazon listings).I believe that is done, not just to save time, but to try to catch the buyer who misses this fact and bet on how many actually return it after realizing it and the hours and hours it takes to pick the perfect Mobo.Whoever is listing this item is clearly not all that honest as omission is just as fraudulent as misrepresentation (the two are the same).SELLER: PLEASE CHANGE THE PICTURES AND/OR MAKE IT CLEAR THIS HAS NO THUNDERBOLT CARD, stop trying catch the buyer in a mistake, it's enough of a process choosing a Mobo. To have this deception is just one big let down and has made me flag the seller and make sure I never buy from them, but was it the seller that listed this, not the others that just added their product to the listing (which one made the listing? who knows).  Maybe some of the other sellers are actually selling the Mobo pictured and specified, probably not as this card adds $60-70 to the price).  The Mobo WITH thunderbolt is typically $359 and from the info I was able to gather, has no better transfer speed than USB 3.0 (Better availability and diverse use across many devices now), UNLESS you happen to have the right external drive connected to the thunderbolt as dictated by the way the thunderbolt is routed through the Mobo, in other words, it's unusual to just happen to get the right device required to get a small improvement in transfer speed).  Not worth the money when USB 3.0 is much more integrated among most external products (even keyboards and mice now).  This Mobo has 10 USB 3.0 connectors and can be multiplied via any of the PCI slots at the bottom.  The only positive is that it will add up to 6 more ports, (the add-on card from ASUS is $300 or $50 per port OR $60 if purchased with this Mobo or $12 per port, much more competitive).  There is also some kind of interface with the GPU that I am not clear on ATM, but I think that is best used on laptops, not desktops). I wanted that Thunderbolt card as I need as many ports as possible before I have to goto the PCI slots that I want to reserve to add more internal SATA drives (my box holds 8 HDDs with ability to house another 7)If you want a correct listing(s) with a really good set of images and description for THIS Mobo, see here: [...]Show this seller that you do not agree with this kind of deceptive, cut and paste without any research type of tactic that they will just dismiss to something that the buyer should just know (although Amazon payed for the return,that cost is not Amazon's, it's the sellers.  If you choose NOT to take heed to this these sellers will continue to misrepresent their products never double checking their images versus the actual product (intentionally or not).  To show an image and NOT note that it is mistakenly showing a $70 part that is NOT included, is just not right.  Especially for anything over $100, which should have the correct and verified image/description comparing the boxes of the items they ARE selling.  how hard is it to compare the same images right on the box versus what they are posting?  This is just something that I seem to see a lot more lately (more prevalent the more the item costs) and it's just not right.  Regardless of how much they spend on inventory, the $300 for this Mobo is a lot for me and I expect a thorough listing that is correct.  It took me several days (8-10 hours of comparing the internet prices and reviews) to finally settle on this Mobo and to have this pop up when it's delivered is just a letdown, but not a make or break thing as it is priced correct, lol, but $300 to add later or return and wait 2 weeks for the credit to be returned so I could get the correct Mobo (without using credit) because I was strapped after adding another $900 for the CPU, RAM, etc... needed to get this running (anything I could remove from my system at the time, I used, but you need to be sure you have the right RAM and CPU for ANY new Mobo.Anyway, sorry for the length, I just want this to stop and unless we complain to Amazon whenever we see it and NOT buy from those sellers at ANY time later, this is going to continue.  Maybe if they made it easier to find the Mobo you want without 50% of the results being irrelevant (that goes for any searches on Amazon, frankly, my mind would not be frazzled so much that I missed this error in the listing by saving 25% to 50% time spent searching and sorting irrelevant items.  Add more search tags so that we are not searching the product names and descriptions, just the tags (but that would require more time for the seller to list a high value item, oops).  It would be nice to search ""Motherboard socket 1155"" and just get back all ""Motherboard socket 1155"" novel, I know. :)",0,2,0.0009346072,0.008918642,0.9901468
"Overall, I like Zagg stuff.  It works as advertised and does create a shield for touch-screen devices.  I have a Zagg shield for my Android phone and now I bought this shield for my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  But here's why I only gave the product two stars:When I installed this shield, I first ran a HEPA air purifier in my office for fifteen minutes to make sure I had no hair, dust, or lint in the air.  I thoroughly washed and scoured my hands.  I then cleaned the screen of the tablet thoroughly to make sure there was not a smudge, streak, fingerprint, or a speck of dust, lint, or hair.  As recommended in the instructions, I then coated my fingers with the spray they include (had a brief problem priming the pump and thought at first I'd have to return the whole package).  I then coated both sides of the shield with the spray as recommended.  I then had a little trouble aligning the shield (it's not a perfect fit, but actually slightly smaller than the screen area).  As recommended, I then used the included squeegee to push out the fluid and air bubbles, starting from the center and working my way out.  Lastly, I applied a light heat from a hair dryer to speed up the process-- as recommended in the ""hint"" section of the application instructions.I now have to wait 24-48 hours before using my device according to the instructions.  But here's what I can tell you at this point:As desired, I have a shield that looks like it will protect the screen from scratches.  But I also have a large pool of fluid all over my office desk, a thoroughly wet tablet, raised edges on the shield that will surely only grow with time (as they did on my phone), and several small lint/air bubbles in various locations under the shield that I was unable to remove from under the shield.  I also have lost the smooth and slick touch of the original touch screen and now have a more sticky surface due to the shield which I'll need to get used to.There has simply got to be a better way to protect tablet screens.  My understanding is that some tablets come with Gorilla glass, but the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 does not.  In the future, I would consider a real glass tablet so that this shield would be unnecessary.  It's an absolute mess to install, it never aligns perfectly, and no matter how hard you try, there always seems to be at least one tiny piece of dust or air that creates a maddening Mt. Everest somewhere on the screen and shield.These shields remind me of those ungodly black leather bras that some people put on their Porches to protect the front end.  Yes, it creates a shield.  But there is irony in destroying the beauty, design, and/or functionality of anything simply to protect it.",0,2,0.020871313,0.16989419,0.80923456

"I bought the Nabi 7 for my 2.5 year old, and he did love it initially (what 2-3 year old wouldn't).

Many of these additional costs are accessible from apps and menus available to the child.  These apps cannot be disabled, even from the ""parent"" account (this is by design, confirmed by Nabi).  Similarly, the apps cannot be removed from the Android desktop (this is also by design, confirmed by Nabi).

"I am a huge fan of AT, I have several models such as the mk700's and m50's.  I also own a few Sennheiser's including open/closed backs.I bought these because of the sale, and I wanted an open back pair of AT's to use while I listen to music in a room that gets a bit warm this time of year.The FIt:The headphones are designed for someone like the incredible hulk to wear.  I have a large head (I wear a fitted ball cap size XXL) and these cans did not stay on.  They do not adjust and I knew this going into the purchase.  The foam pads are oddly designed.  It is like that were hollowed out and formed into an angle which prevents a nice secure fit around your head (like a funnel).  They place quite a bit of odd pressure on your jaw bone which to me, is discomforting.  They slide back and always feel like they are going to fall off into your lap.The Sound:Everyone who owns a pair of AT's knows how great they sound for the money you spend.  This pair of AD700's sound like a pair of tweeters being played through a hollow coffee can.  I know your thoughts now (hey dummy.. they are open design, you&#8217;re playing through your fisher price sound card, you didn&#8217;t break them in ).. I use an Asus Xonar Essence STX professional sound card that mag-shielded and has a built in headphone amp.  Even if I EQ these to pump up mid-range and bass, it's no help.  When I play them through my Fiio it&#8217;s the same lousy sound stage.Treble:- It&#8217;s there in abundance.  Clear through any volume.Mids:- This is all you will get.  It's clear but sounds distant as if the driver in the headphone is far away and underpowered despite bumping up the amp's output and EQ.Bass:- I didn't buy these as my &#34;bumping bass&#34; pair of cans.  With that said, the bass is almost non-existent even when you EQ them.  I wanted a full natural sound with an open back for air circulation, and they do not fulfill any of the low end.Overall Impression:- The build has a nice quality feel to it, however they just seemed to miss the target when they designed the fit, and the overall sound production is weak and distant.  I would look towards the m50's or for open air and similar price the Sennheiser 518's will be a huge improvement over these.",0,1,0.31901687,0.47215942,0.2088237

It is a very average mouse at a trumped up price. You could buy a microsoft mouse at half the price that will do the job just as well if not better.

That means I either have to leave the adapter in the laptop or let it fly around in my bag. I prefer to take it out of the laptop simply because even the small adapters like this will ruin USB slots over time from being bumped around in a bag.The biggest issue for me, however, is that the when putting the computer to sleep, any movement of the mouse will turn it back on unless I turn off the mouse before putting the laptop to sleep.

"I have long been a huge fan of the A5, and now the A5+ is even better (Have owned both).Twice I have purchased the A2 over the past few years and both times returned them.I wanted to like them but the sound has a fatal flaw: the midrange is coarse.This was confirmed for me by a review in whathifi dot com.I don't know why others fail to hear this.The little A2's look beautiful and punch way above their weight.They are truly a remarkable accomplishment.It is just that even when fed a very clean signal, they abuse the midrange.Other notes:  I prefer to have volume control on the front, again like the a5 and a5+.In this price range (actually lower) I have had EXCELLENT results from the M-Audio AV40.It seems to be the sweet spot in the M-Audio line.The AV30 sounded hideous (I suspect a class D amp is used).The larger M-Audio models use professional input and have independent volume for right and left channels (a pain for a consumer).The AV40 is much larger than the A2, but much smaller than the A5 series.",0,2,0.05415939,0.077558294,0.86828226

"We just wanted a cheap DVD player.  We don't play bizarre regions or formats, just one that would play typical movies from netflix.  We bought this one thinking it would fit the bill perfectly and would have progressive scan for when we upgraded to a better TV.  We hooked it up and I found that on most DVDs for part of the time, the picture would skip and roll - almost like the vertical hold was off on an old TV.  Now, our TV is older (maybe 7 years?) and doesn't have component video or S-Video, so we were using the older Yellow Red White Composite video input.  Perhaps Philips didn't bother to test this well since most TVs now have S-Video? we don't know.I was pleased to find Philips had a support number and they were even open until 11pm, but when we called they had no idea what hte problem was, and offered us an exchange.  Great we thought!  Oh, but WE'D have to pay for the item to be shipped to them.  EXCUSE ME?  They sold us a defective unit and we have to pay to get a new one.  I don't think so.

"I bought two of these because I wanted to have off-site back-up, as well as a &#34;personal&#34; drop box to use at my remote office without having to go on the internet. The two units constantly disconnect, files can't be reached, or worst, after one can't connect for a while and gets out of sync, it will ask you if you want to connect and will over-write current files with the older files. (The app will ask you if you want to connect, but the first time you don't know what you're getting into. If it hadn't been for Dropbox's &#34;version&#34; back-up, I'd have lost some valuable work.) I've had the remote location one go off-line for two days at a time, which is a lot of saves to lose if you accidentally overwrite with older files.The short of it is, these do not work as advertised, at least not consistently. If they did, they'd be terrific. And it's not operator error, either.  I run a Windows media server, a half-dozen Macs, two PCs, and four DVRS, plus many, many phones and tablets on my networks. All of them work. These didn't. The entire point of something like this is to have transparent back-up, and a personal cloud.vI gave them two stars instead of one because the IDEA is great, particularly the &#34;library&#34; function, which allows you to store the files on the Transporter drives only, but the idea isn't executed or thought through well enough.I was only synching these with my Macs, so perhaps that's an issue, but honestly, any NAS storage should be transparent to operating systems, especially if they are advertising themselves as a Dropbox replacement.",0,0,0.705924,0.23924188,0.054834146
"Bought these based on the glowing reviews here and on headfi-dot-org because I needed a good, reliable portable set of headphones to use during my frequent business trips. I have owned and still use a pair of Sennheiser HD555s at home.I didn't buy these expecting these to sound like the HD555 -- but I did expect very good response across high and mid frequencies, which these do deliver in spades! In fact the soundstage is excellent and separation between instruments very pleasing (tried out some classical music composed by Howard Hansen and Jeff Buckley's ""Grace"" Legacy Edition remaster with these). However, these are rated on Sennheiser's website at 10-21Hz, but you wouldn't know it: when the volume is turned up these distort WAY too easily! Also, what I find inexcusable in the age of digital music is that when I connect these to my iPhone 4S, either with a headphone amp or without, there is hardly any volume even when the source is cranked up! And as I wrote before, they distort way to easily at higher volume.Also, the only way I could get decent bass response was to hold the phones to my ears -- and I'm not doing that during an hour-long (or longer) plane ride. And I did try every conceivable way to get a good seal.File under ""Very disappointed"".  This sounds crazy, but I may be very well going back to the cheapo Coby CV185 headphones I bought these to replace -- they're only $10 at my local discount store, but they sound damn good for that price!

The router has intermittent connection issues. Some days it works great, other days I've had it dropping connections. I've also had issues with my IP address being reassigned to other devices and windows telling me I have ip address conflicts (To hopefully fix this issue there is a setting in the router to assign a specific mac address to an ip address). We probably have about 10 or so devices connected to the router. And lastly, I bought a Western Digital USB Hard Drive and connected it to the router. The problem is, the drive appears to go into sleep mode and the router does not know how to keep it active or reawaken it so that feature is completely useless.On a positive note, the signal strength of the 2.4Ghz 802.11n band is great and reaches all corners of the house compared with my old 802.11g router.",0,0,0.8446707,0.14940028,0.0059289555

I already own a K3 and an iPad but would love to have the best of both in the 7"" size.  However, all of a sudden the screen went so dim that at first glance it appears to be off.

It has an attractive design and feels substantial / high-quality (even if it's apparently not).  If you are used to a capacitive screen (iPod Touch, iPad, etc...) then you are going to find this hard to navigate on at first but if you are going to use this as mostly a backlit e-reader you will be fine.

"Shopping for a DVD player is something I've dreaded. It seems every DVD player model I've seen fails. My dad got a brand new Sony combo VCR and DVD--it skips on new movies. My brother got a used Samsung--same thing. My friend's Xbox spins up and never plays, just starts grinding. My friend's Philips will sometimes read movies and sometimes won't--how scratched they are or not has little impact, except that they're slightly more likely to confuse it if they are. But brand new DVDs without a spot on them still confuse it. It got so frustrating that I finally caved and decided I needed to replace the thing, as much as it was nice to be able to watch movies (sometimes, at least) for free (albeit with lots of headaches).When I ran across this Panasonic, there were no serious negative reviews. No total red flags. The price was good and the features were suitable.But the very first time I tried to load a DVD, the tray withdrew as the DVD was half in--it extended to its full open position and hovered there for a split second when it reversed course. The DVD, which it snatched from my hand in the process, got stuck, and I feared it would be destroyed. But I pressed the eject button and it came out. But again, the tray withdrew very quickly. I looked in the manual--nothing. Inexplicably, one time it stayed open like other DVD players I've seen--long enough to put in or take out a movie and then some. But then it reverted back to its spastic opening and closing behavior. And sometimes when you press open (or click it on the remote), it didn't actually open, it just stuck out a little and said it was open. And then horrible grinding noises came out of it. And then I clicked close and it closed, and then I clicked open and it opened--and then withdrew. The grinding noise stopped. And once it a while it worked fine--I think maybe 3 or 4 times out of dozens of times opening and closing it, it actually did what I asked it to do.Putting a DVD in is like trying to draw a gun faster in a duel: You watch intently and you keep your trigger finger ready, but if you're off by a fraction of a second, you're a dead man. It's completely unacceptable, which is a pity, because I was going to give Panasonic a chance. Now I'm thinking of hitting a couple other brands and seeing if any actually work or if all DVD players are doomed to bugs like these.Ironically, so far it has had little trouble actually reading the movies and playing them. The remote works fine, although as other reviewers mentioned it's a bit small without much finger space. And there's no separate pause button, which is annoying because sometimes I accidentally hit pause.I'd order a replacement of the same type since feature wise it's perfect, but a bug like this right up front just doesn't give me any confidence the replacement will not also fail soon. And since DVD players seem to only have 90 day warranties (on labor, which they'd likely bill it as) most of the time, I'm not confident the manufacturer has any confidence in their product lasting longer than that. So, I've decided to return it.",0,0,0.547997,0.40151805,0.050485007

Speakers are just ok.I've had two of these and they both had major issues.1st W510 - flakey touchpad, random lockups2nd W510 - flakey touchpad, random sound loss, hard to dock to keyboardI would really like to have kept it but not if I can't get any official support other than ""send us your brand new tablet and dock for repair"".  I think they have a winning product here but they need to step it up with quality control, software updates and customer support.*Update 12/30/12I've been busy since returning the W510.  I've purchased a Lenovo Yoga, an HP Envy X2, and a Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2.Lenovo Yoga - Fast, Sleek, and expensive.  I had to try something a little stronger and faster...and it was both.  Not a fair comparison to the Atom convertibles but a great machine none the less.  Mine boots up in about 7 seconds.  If you need an Ultra Book first and an occasional tablet second this is probably perfect for you.  It was too big for me for around the house use, plus the fan runs constantly blowing warm air.  I love that you can add memory and swap or add a second SSD.HP Envy X2 - I had a tough time choosing between this and the ThinkPad Tablet 2 so I ordered both.  Compared to the W510 the X2 comes out on top in every way except for price.  It is made of brushed aluminum and looks amazing.  The  build quality it superb, it feels like an Apple product.  It does everything the W510 does except bend over backwards for display mode.  I was surprised how light the X2 tablet is considering it is made of metal. Unlike the W510 the track pad supports gestures and the dock has a full sized SD card slot in addition to the micro SD slot on the tablet itself.  The keyboard looks and feels better to type on than the W510.  I wish the keyboard had a backlight.  To be fair, none of these machines have a backlit keyboard.  The charger that came with the Envy X2 works but the amber charging LED is faulty.  It flashes randomly and sometimes stays lit like it is supposed to.  When the tablet is fully charged the led turns and stays bright white.  I think I just got a bad LED in my charger as it works just fine otherwise.

"I received this as a gift, which as such was really cool from the friends who gave it to me. This model's appeal in particular is that it can send your photos to your computer wirelessly, so let me get that right out of the way: you can eventually get it to work, but it saps the battery quickly (and I had two), and more importantly... I just could never get a good picture out of it, so the wi-fi wizardry is for naught.As a camera... What a disappointment; this applies to most point and shoots: they seem to get many eye catching parameters right, except the important ones. Large LCD screen? Check. Big brand name? Hey it's a Nikon so it must be good, right? Wi-fi wizardry or some such? Check. Results? Awful.Whenever you try to get a picture it tries to ""think"" for you, never relinquishes control... And eventually takes the shot... So the moment you were trying to capture is gone, unless you like having people grin artificially for ten minutes... It tries to flash at the slightest provocation, resulting in those garish ""tourist"" shots; you can disable the flash but then it's completely underexposed... Because I've always had somewhat shaky hands my shots always came out blurry. The only good point about this camera in particular is its macro mode - with the right lighting, loads of time and even more patience. But right after I lent this camera and one of the batteries was lost, it's just been gathering dust. What a waste!But even worse, honestly, is that the experience is bad enough to kill any photographic aspirations, and that's my biggest beef with this camera and its brethren. I ended up buying a Canon 30D DSLR and that's been great; while I remain brand agnostic what could I possibly believe from Nikon?So my advice is simple: If you're getting a camera for yourself, look at a cheap DSLR, and if you're worried about the size, look at the Olympus range of small DSLRs like theOlympus Evolt E520 10MP Digital SLR Camera with Image Stabilization w/ 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lensor compacts but not point and shoots like theCanon PowerShot G11 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch articulating LCD, thePanasonic DMC-LX3 10.1MP Digital Camera with 24mm Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)or their equivalent in other brands: You are buying this to unleash your creativity, for which you need to learn and eventually use manual control...

"Sorry for the long review, but figured a new product like this needed a thorough breakdown. At work I have a 27"" iMac, as well as a 15"" MacBook Pro that's hooked up to an external monitor and running both Mac OS and Windows 7.  Previously I was using a standard Apple wired keyboard and had to physically switch it back and forth between the two computers. Then in an effort to clean up cable clutter on my desk I switched to the Apple wireless keyboard. But that can only be effectively paired to one computer at a time, so I still had to bring out the wired keyboard for my laptop any time the screen was closed and I was outputting to the external monitor. So when this Kanex Multi-Sync Keyboard was announced, with support for 3 Bluetooth-capable systems, it seemed like I had finally found an answer to my multi-computer dilemma. While I'm happy to report that the Bluetooth switching works well, everything else about the keyboard comes up short.The first thing I noticed is that despite the attractive photos, the keyboard is entirely plastic and painted silver to emulate the Apple aluminum look. This gives it a light, cheap feeling compared to Apple's keyboards or the Logitech K750 (which is plastic too, but sleeker and with significantly better finish). Also, the layout of the standard Apple hotkeys are in different places in order to make room for the 3 Bluetooth keys, located next to the Esc key. I'm still hitting the F11 and F12 keys for volume out of habit, and on this keyboard those are mapped to Fast Forward and Shut Down. To me it would have made a lot more sense if the Bluetooth keys had been placed above the keypad, where the Bluetooth LEDs are already located, so that the traditional Apple hotkey layout could have been maintained. My biggest gripe with the build of the keyboard, though, is with the keys themselves. They feel much different than the Apple or Logitech keys and take a lot more force to push down. I'm constantly hitting backspace with this thing. Usually it's the ""e"" button for some reason. When you have to constantly correct your spelling it puts more strain on your fingers and wrist which you all know is not a good thing. I have moderate carpal tunnel and tendonitis in both arms, so I definitely feel it more with this keyboard than the others I've recently used. The spacing is fine and the size of the keys is fine, it's just the response of the keys that needs to be improved. I already miss the light, effortless typing of the two Apple keyboards.I was willing to look past these shortcomings, but not the Bluetooth performance. While the switching works pretty reliably between different computers, it frequently gets disconnected if a system is inactive for a period of time. Most mornings when I get to work it takes around 30 seconds for the keyboard to be recognized again - this is after pressing keys, hitting the correct Bluetooth button or even switching back and forth between different Bluetooth channels to try and get my iMac to see it again. It's really frustrating when you have to hit the ground running and you can't even use your keyboard. If that wasn't bad enough, I am regularly seeing a delay between a key being pressed and it appearing on my screen. Even as I'm typing this review, I see a noticeable lag in the words. If you're like me and type fast without looking at your keyboard, it can be a little unnerving waiting for your words to catch up with your fingers. I haven't experienced this with the Apple or Logitech Bluetooth keyboards, both of which I own. Finally, one last thing about Bluetooth - this keyboard is not recognized by either of my Macs during boot up, which makes it impossible to select Option Boot (in order to get into Windows instead of Mac OS). You'll have to use a different keyboard or log into Mac OS and use Target Disk Mode to change the boot OS, both inconvenient options. (FYI - the Apple Bluetooth keyboard IS recognized during boot up, so there is obviously some feature inside that makes it instantly recognized during startup. Other vendors need to get on this and find out what that is!)The only positives for this keyboard is that it costs less than the Logitech equivalent (the K811) while providing a full-sized keypad. But the performance and overall fit and finish is definitely lacking, and for this price, you'd expect something a little more race ready. Kanex has a great idea with this device and could have a hit on their hands, but they really need to improve on it if it's going to become a household name for Apple users.",0,2,0.03177422,0.07917791,0.8890478

"I was planning to buy this camcorder as a gift for a friend. Then I did my homework. I browsed owner-posted comments in camcorder forums. I borrowed a friend's R10 and tried it out for the day. I went to a camcorder outlet store and spent several hours trying out competitors to this camcorder.  I compared the R10 spec's against its competitors. I spent way more time researching this than you'll ever want to.I concluded nobody should buy this camcorder.This camcorder has several critical flaws, and has only a couple minor advantages over its competitors. By the way, I happily own several Canon camcorders (HF S100, and HF M300) so I have nothing against the Canon brand.MAJOR FLAWS:-> Poorly isolated microphone records ANNOYING ""ticking"" noise movement of autofocus mechanism. (This is reported by hundreds of owners in multiple online forums.) Your video ends up with annoying background ""woodpecker"" sound, very noticeable in video of quieter scenes. (You can solve that by only using your camcorder to record video of woodpeckers!)  It is impractical to try solving this with an external mic, because the R10/R11/R100 has the mic input but no mic mount (are you gonna walk around carrying a camcorder in one hand and a boom mic in the other?)-> Short spec sheet claims ""full 1920 x 1080 recording"" but that is a lie because camcorder is limited to 1664 x 936, which it then interpolates up to 1920 x 1080. That's pathetic! (and the result doesn't look as crisp as true 1920 x 1080). Yet for about $40 over the price of the R10 you can buy the Canon M300, which has a sensor that can capture at true 1920 x 1080, and has twice the effective pixels in video mode.-> This camcorder supports no mounting of any attachments; there is no standard cold (or hot) shoe, or mini Advanced hot shoe.  In many shooting situations, you'll end up with lousy video because you couldn't attach the accessory needed to get good video.-> It doesn't even have a filter thread to add filters or lenses!  Yet it doesn't even include a integrated wider-angle lens, as seen in some competitor camcorders. Try shooting video of a couple sitting next to each other across the dinner table from you; this camcorder can maybe get ONE of their two faces into the frame, due to lack of wide-angle lens. Yet for a few bucks more you could buy a Canon HF M300/M30/M31/M32 to which you can attach a host lenses/filters such as a wide-angle lens, and also attach other accessories (to mini Advanced hot shoe) and then retain and re-use those accessories when you eventually upgrade to something like the Vixia HF S200/S20/S21-> The pathetically small 720mAh battery dies way too soon (some owners say under 45 min). This camcorder doesn't use the current standard Canon camcorder batteries (BP-808, BP-819, BP-827, etc.) that are available in a wide range of capacities, and at low cost in non-OEM form.-> Suffers from washed-out grainy video in low-light (or even medium light), a drawback common to most all Canon camcorders in the HF and FS tiers. Dynamic range also rather limited.MAJOR ADVANTAGES to the R10/R11/R100:-> No touch screen! Most competitor camcorders (of similar small size) unfortunately have touch screens that are usually cumbersome to use as result of too many touch locations jammed across a very small (often rather unresponsive) LCD touch surface. I have a Canon camcorder w/o touch screen and a Canon w/a touch screen. I can literally make menu/function adjustments 3X as fast on the non-touch screen Canon. I like the LCD mounted button and 4-way Navi button found on the R10 camcorder.-> This is a relatively cute looking camcorder and it comes in multiple colors.-> For English-as-second language customers, this (and most Canon camcorders) support quickly changing all menus to display in one of many available language options, ranging from Euro-languages to Asian languages such as Japanese, Korean, Chinese Simplified or Chinese Traditional, etc.MY ADVICE:If you want Canon brand and in this size and tier, consider a camcorder in the M300/M30/M31/M32 series, because they are only approx. $40 more but are a far better camcorder. However, in this size and tier of camcorders, many would recommend other brands such as the Panasonic or Sony, because some camcorders (in same size and tier class) from both those brands are considered superior. You might consider something in the Panasonic HDC-SD60 series, or Sony HDR-CX110 or HDR-CX150.Finally, I think that the typical NON-techie type consumers looking at these low-end camcorders, will discover they don't like dealing with the CPU-intensive highly-compressed ""raw"" AVCHD format (MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 ) files that are spit out by many mid and higher tier consumer camcorders. They will be frustrated to find native AVCHD format files won't play on their PC using most media players. More frustration will result when they discover they need a VERY fast PC to edit full HD AVCHD and render it to a conveniently playable format.  I think that non-techie type consumer is better off selecting a camcorder that saves its video (which might be H.264) directly in *.mp4 multimedia container format file, immediately playable on their PC by a multitude of media players.",0,0,0.7996411,0.17413116,0.026227849

"I was having really slow wireless speeds as far as loading webpages and downloading larger files goes. I have a 50x10 connection and would pull about 1.5x3 wirelessly standing right next to the router. I called tech support last night and sat on hold for 57 mins and someone finally answered and said they are busy but took my name and number to call me back shortly. Not surprisingly, no one ever called me back so I called again to day and after I got through finally the lady I spoke to said that they get a lot of calls for this issue, but that I'm just not understanding how wireless works and that if it shows 65mbps in the connection status, I should be getting that speed and if I'm not getting that speed its not the routers fault and to call my internet provider. (I'm a field tech for a large cable company...good one lady) Nevermind the fact that it works properly hard wired.

"I'm ambivalent about this review.The pros are that this backpack has a lot of room and carries everything well.The cons are signficant.1) if you are a semi-muscular person, the shoulder straps could hurt. The one thing that other owners of this knapsack have commented on is that this problem could be solved if Wenger had just put cross strap that crosses in front of one's chest and connects the two shoulder straps.2) one of the shoulder straps has a place for a cell phone. There are a couple of problems with it. First, it is way too narrow to fit a smartphone (e.g. an iPhone or a BlackBerry). It can only fit an old-fashioned cell phone (i.e. a non-smartphone). Second, the bottom of this cell phone holder is a major weak spot for the knapsack. It broke apart after a month. The worst thing is that I've seen this exact same problem on several different Wenger backpacks.3) the other shoulder strap has completely fallen apart.Wenger needs to redesign the shoulder straps for their backpacks. They have a great product otherwise, but since many people are carrying laptops in their backpacks, shoulder straps that break apart endanger laptops. In contrast, I've had an L.L. Bean backpack for 10 years and have put them same amount of stuff in it. The shoulder straps are still intact, however, the Wenger backpack has better aesthetics.NOTE: I have to write an update. If you want absolutely great customer service, then Wenger is the company. I went to their website and found the email address for the Warranty Department. I sent an email and they responded within 30 minutes. They asked for some readily available information and a few pics of the problem. I sent it to them and they responded within 30 minutes that I needed to pay $10 for shipping and handling by PayPal. I did this and they again sent me a reply email within 30 minutes that a replacement backpack was going to be sent to me. I received it the very next day. I did not have to waste any time or energy sending back the defective backpack, and now I have a perfect knapsack again. Wow! Truly A+ customer service.I'm still unsure about the quality of this item, but no other company I've ever dealt with has the customer service of Wenger. This company totally deserves its excellent reputation.If this backpack holds up, then I will revise and give it far more stars.",0,1,0.18759514,0.72870535,0.08369947

"I believe I would have rated this camera at 4 stars, except it was defective and needed to be returned.  The problem was it froze repeatedly.  I would press the button to release the shutter, capturing the shot in the view finder, but nothing happened after that.  That image remained in the viewfinder indefinitely.  The only way I found to unfreeze it was to remove the batteries.  Occasionally, the freezing would happen while it was writing the picture to the card;  in that case, the viewfinder would be black and the power switch would blink.  Again, that went on indefinitely until the batteries were removed.  Pressing any button would have no effect while the camera was frozen.  The happened often after just one or two shots.  I believe the longest the camera worked without freezing was 6 or 7 shots.  I looked on-line for advice and found little;  I tried re-formatting the card--that had no effect on the situation.Had the camera worked without freezing, I would have been happy with it.  It had a good feel, turned on quickly and had a wide assortment of settings.  The electronic stabilization worked extremely well--pictures taken at full zoom were crisp and well-focused.One thing I did not like about the Pentax is that you cannot screw a u/v lens to the front, so the lens is completely unprotected once the lens cover is removed.  It was a hassle to remove the cover each time you started up the camera, and then remember to replace it after each use.  My old camera had a tube that covered the lens even when it was fully extended which accepted a u/v lens.  As a result, the primary lens was fully protected at all times without any operator intervention.After returning this camera, I decided to Panasonic Lumix FZ200.  It seems to have much the same features of the Pentax, but accepts filters over the lens.  It requires a specific battery (an additional advantage of the Pentax is that it uses 4 standard AA batteries), and is considerable more expensive than the Pentax, but seems to have similar features otherwise.",0,0,0.7658292,0.19637279,0.03779803

"As a previous Garmin GPS owner (nuvi 350) I expected some nice design features and good functionality in a robust package.  The 1490LMT may embody great design principles in terms of production cost in the view of the team that produces it and sells it but in my hands it feels fragile and prone to damage.1) There is no case to put it in when it is not in use.  This is not a small GPS and leaving it mounted in the vehicle is a temptation to thieves. putting it away without a case invites scratches and damage.2) The mount that is provided is not as versatile as previous versions. The ball and socket design is nice but on this version the arm that connects the cradle to the base is shorter and does not have the hinge that previous versions did.  This limits the placement for a unit whose large size already provides challenges for installation.3) The power connector is a mini USB connector on the rear lower corner and is connected via a right-angle USB plug.  Because of the connector placement the power cord then juts out behind the unit and below the unit making it impractical to mount flush to the back or the bottom.  There is no strain relief and the mini USB socket is prone to damage. (previous versions had a flush connector via the mounting arm)4) The 12V lighter adapter is HUGE and sticks out past the lighter receptacle about 2 1/2 inches, and carrys with it what I'm guessing is the traffic antenna.  This make it difficult and probably more expensive to replace than a simpler power only cable.  Normally I'd hide the power cable under the dash for mounting and run the traffic antenna somewhere there is better reception.  (we don't get traffic services here so I can't use the traffic functionality anyway)5) The audio quality has the unit pronouncing 'county road TT' as 'grondig ET' or something equally undecipherable. Yes there are other voices but other units I have tried are not cryptic like this one.6) display updating is perceptibly slow, zooming out leaves an un-drawn band around the displayed area  while it slowly repaints the display.  It is not just slow it is annoying, like web surfing with an ancient dial-up modem.7) touch sensitive processing is awkward when trying to drag the map to a side.  it seems to forget that you are dragging the screen image and then wakes up again and instead of continuing to drag it will zoom in on where your finger IS which is not where the image is because it didn't follow your finger press.  it then zooms the image putting the desired point past the edge of the visible area.I'm puzzled as to what happened at Garmin that they produced a unit with so many usability hurdles.  This device feels as if it should be in a better physical housing with a more versatile mount and a faster processor.

"We purchased this router to replace an old Linksys WRT54GS router in my parent's home.  The Linksys is a wireless B/G router and I wanted to move them to wireless N since I had just purchased an Apple TV for them.  My expectation was that I would establish a good connection at 5GHz for the Apple TV and avoid some interference problems that we had with the Linksys (firmware 4.71.4) and the kitchen microwave at 2.4GHz.  I didn't expect the range to be particularly spectacular, but the distance was short enough between the router and the Apple TV that I didn't think it would cause a problem.On the positive side, let me say that there is a decent feature set for this router.  Not only does it have the capability to handle network traffic on the 2.4GHz and 5 GHz bands simultaneously, it has the ability offer a guest SSID (on the 2.4GHz band only) for when you have friends/kids over and you want to keep them off of your internal network while still providing them with Internet connectivity.  It also has a USB port that provides you with DLNA compatible media sharing.  From a technical specifications side of things, this router is not bad.  Another plus (IMO) is that there is only 1 light to show you status.  If it's solid green, you're good to go.  Some people may like all those bright blue lights all the time, but I am thoroughly sick of them.  Most home offices look like a disco these days.Then there's the real world.  The first issue is the so-so range on the Belkin N600.  This is a tough one to detail, since every comparison is unique.  Range is determined by where you place your router, the distance between the router and the client, as well as the number of obstacles and their composition (sheetrock, wood, metal, etc.).  So let me compare it like this.  The Linksys WRT54GS consistently gave us 4 out of 5 bars on 2.4GHz from the office (router) to the kitchen/dining room (laptop client).  The N600 gave us 3-4 bars (4 more often than 3) at 2.4GHz and 1-2 bars (1 more often than 2) at 5GHz.  Plus the microwave interference was still there at 2.4GHz even after I switched from channel 6 to channel 11.But the killer was the Apple TV.  That was in the living room and connected on 5GHz with the Belkin N600 at 4 out of 5 bars.  ""Cool"" I thought.  But that was as good as it got.  Why?  Because for some reason, this Belkin router does not route Bonjour traffic.  I have not yet seen a resolution to this problem.  Ironically, when I did the initial research on this router, I checked for Amazon reviews and there were none.  One day later, Michael Norton's review shows up on Amazon.  If I had know what he said, I would never have purchased the device.  There are discussion threads concerning this issue on Apple's website with no real resolution.  People who say that it works don't realize that they are using the N600 HD which is a different device.  Other's suggest updating the firmware.  There is no updated firmware for the N600 as of the date of this review.  The only firmware available is the firmware that ships with the unit (1.00.27).  On the off chance that there was an update that was mislabeled, I downloaded the firmware on the Belkin website and re-flashed the router.  The version was identical and the results were identical.So, it went back.  If you never need to use Apple's Bonjour protocol, then maybe this will be the device for you (my 2010 Macbook Pro worked fine on the Internet).  But if you're looking to use an Apple TV, don't bother.  Not unless Belkin resolves this issue in a firmware update.But there is a silver lining (for me at least). While I was waiting for the Apple TV to arrive, I flashed the firmware on the Linksys WRT54GS with DD-WRT that I have used successfully in the past on numerous other routers.  I didn't need to.  I planned on selling the router.  But since we now needed it again, I reconnected it and programmed it.  Lo and behold, that little old router, re-flashed with a free 3rd-party firmware, no longer has interference from the microwave at 2.4GHz ( at channel 11) and the connection quality is 4-5 out of 5 bars to both the laptop in the kitchen and the Apple TV in the living room.  I never would have thought that the solution to all our problems was right in front of us all along.  But it was.  I would still like to upgrade them from WiFi-G to WiFi-N at some point.  But with Apple TV only streaming 720P, WiFi-G can handle it with a reasonably strong signal.So guess what?  Out with the new and in with the old!! HUH?!?! Happy New Year!",0,2,0.046840418,0.26780075,0.6853589
"First, be sure your market is listed before you buy the product.  However, just because your market is listed doesn't mean you'll get good reception.  I have a portable, battery operated digital TV so I know what a ""good"" portable antenna digital signal can give you.  My other TV is not great, but it's watchable with some maneuvering.  I didn't have unreasonable expectations for this product. I just wanted a signal.  That being said, it only picks up one, maybe two, channels (depending on where you are, at some locations around the house, no channels are picked up).Also, I noticed in the manual that it has an * on the ""no subscription fee"" that says ""subject to change at any time.""  Their website says, ""Is there a subscription fee for Dyle mobile TV?  Dyle mobile TV is available with no subscription fee through the end of 2013.""  So, my guess is that there will be a subscription fee in the future.This product is a great idea.  I've always said a TV Tuner (like is built in to many computers) for an iPad would be a great idea, especially in areas where the power goes out frequently.  However, this is not a plain TV Tuner that just picks up digital signals.  This depends on some sort of propriety subscription service's signal.  If someone could make a plain TV Tuner, it would be well worth the price of this device.  Don't be fooled into thinking it is a TV tuner.",0,2,0.030306688,0.25071296,0.7189804

"Since I got one of these for $100 at Tech Ed in New Orleans I have been putting it through its paces.Simply:  I hate it.  Yes, I have an iPad.  And two Android devices.  2 Macs.  And lots of laptops between everyone in the family, etc.  Everything, including my DS work better.First, after a month of trying, this wafer thin felt keypad is useless.  You might as well try to to play a piano with your toes.  Microsoft people keep saying it takes some getting used to.  But at all their meetings, none of them are using it. Hello.The touch screen isn't very touchy.  I have to expand the size of a hyperlink, then press a couple times to get it to go.  Irritating.It has a desktop mode but it's bad. Let's see, touch, key, mouse, scroll, there are so many things wrong with the user experience, I can't list them all.  People say it's great because it has the Office Suite on it?  Really? It's useless without the detached keyboard to use the Office Suite, so you have to put it on a table to use the Office suite.  (And why would I do this since I have Office on my Macs and even the old laptops?  What is the compelling reason to do this when you have a solid keyboard on a laptop that actually works?)The Windows RT is a seriously confused device. It's bad at being a tablet, and it's inept as a laptop.And the IE browser?  Don't get me started.  There is one for the big square interface, and a different one in Desktop mode.  Both are inelegant, substandard browsers.There are so many presses, slides, retries, etc, you will get carpal tunnel in your index finger using this device.My company just dropped the  EA it had with Microsoft because the model for their Office Suite is seriously confusing beyond recovery, the Microsoft Team that only shows up to collect their money in the last month of the EA is arrogant, and the Tablets they passed around are only passable as replicas for the black thing at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.It's hard to admit it, but this 64gig Windows RT device isn't even worth the $100 I paid for it.Update:  how many of these are unsold and in stock after a huge loss by Microsoft?

"This year I built a small home theater in my basement.  I have an Epson 5020UB projector, Panny and Samsung BluRay players, Denon X4000 receiver and a 106"" screen.  Projector is about 12' from the screen. All I can say is WOW.

"I'm quite disappointed in the Roku 2 XD. I got it as a birthday gift, but didn't put it to use until more than a year after I got it, when my PS3 died. The supposed HD image is spotty. At times the image quality is great, but other times it will look like it's streaming in standard definition. And it switches back and forth in the middle of shows/movies, so one minute I'll be watching something that looks amazing, and the next it'll suddenly become fuzzy. Also, there are serious problems the Roku having to ""load"" multiple times mid-show/movie. It will sometimes happen 5-10 during the course of a one hour episode. I rarely get through a show without it having to load. It's incredibly annoying and aggravating. Most of the time, it'll take about 5 seconds to load, but sometimes it will take up to 30 seconds, or even stop playing all together. I never had any of these problems when running Netflix or other streaming programs from my PS3.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars (as opposed to one), is because of all the apps you can download, which provide almost endless options for streaming.",0,0,0.51593745,0.46915367,0.014908901

"Ah, guilty of pride. Read all the negative reviews and decided that at this price point and with my reasonably good knowledge of the involved technologies it is worth a try. Well, it was not, and my strong advice to others who seek entertainment with this magnificent piece of PRC craftsmanship is: DON&#8217;T.Here is a quick synopsis:Tried to install on Win 7 64 bit. The drivers included on the distribution disk are dated &#8217;08. There are a more recent version on the internet somewhere in the forums, dated &#8217;10, which does not work at all. There is yet another version somewhere else, which locks up the PC. There also is a newer Win7 version on the Sabrent tech support, but alas, only for 32 bit OS. Perhaps they figured out that going from 32 to this esoteric, never-heard-of 64bit was double the effort and too much for them to support.The packaged PVR software fails with &#8220;failed to configure the TV Tuner&#8221; error message. Opened a ticked with the tech support, mostly as a ritualistic step with little expectation of a positive outcome. Still waiting to hear back, just exactly as anticipated.Windows Media Center does not recognize the tuner. Well, no tears here, but it was still indicative to learn that there is no safe fallback option.After much effort (the card goes into its deeper inner self in protest against any configuration it does not like, to which state a reboot is the only remedy), managed to get a picture on VideoLAN VLC. If you are old enough to recall video quality on 1950ies broadcast tubes, that&#8217;s about it. A good bit of nostalgia not really useful to watching modern TV. The resolution is horrible, colors are off, and no tweaking with contrast/brightness/gamma controls brings the picture to a plausible level of fidelity. Also, on a couple of occasions, the picture was all checkered boxes and stripes. Nothing changed mechanically- or configuration-wise. A reboot cured in both cases. I was not enthusiastic enough to investigate in detail, but my gut feeling is that somehow it was caused by stressed hardware resources. On a bright note, I shall mention that I never saw anything like that with the other three video cards I had in that machine, under the same &#8211; and frequently, much more demanding &#8211; loads.However, we&#8217;d need to travel even further in time, to the era of silent movies, to fully appreciate the true beauty of this device: no matter what I did, no matter how I tried, there was no sound. The manual suggests that the audio output of the card can be connected directly to the speakers. Not exactly so. The manual also suggests that the same output can be connected to the input of a audio card.  Not exactly so, again. Well, let me take it back - it CAN be connected, in that sense that a 3.5mm jack can be fitted into the socket. If the wire is tight enough, you may try to pluck it with your finger: that seems the only way you may get some sound. And I don&#8217;t have to state the obvious: the card is not recognized as an audio input device either in the control panel or in the device manager.Maybe it is all the consequence of out-of-date drivers. Maybe I got a faulty card. More likely, though, it is indomitable spirit of human imagination and nave believe in miracles that prompted me to waste time on attempting, against all better judgment, to try to make a piece of garbage work.&#8230; and almost forgot to mention: the remote control is good for training motor dexterity in your fingers, nothing more; an attempt to apply the remote to any of its designated functions turned up to be totally fruitless.Back it goes, to China with love.",0,0,0.94224983,0.041730378,0.016019763

"The 1 hp version of this model was highly rated in Consumers Reports so I had high hopes for it.  The 1 hp model was too bit to fit under my old sink so I bought this 3/4 model instead.  Here are the issues:1.  The splash guard is poorly designed - the water doesn't flow through the little holes unless your faucet is barely turned on with low flow.  If the water is flowing at a decent rate, the water backs up into the sink.  I have to push the subber sections back with a spoon to get the water to flow into the disposal.  No, my water pipes are not clogged or backed up - it is the splash guard (the black rubber stuff).  If I force the rubber section open, the water flows fine.2.  If you put food in the sink, it just sits there and backs up the water into the sink.  THis is due to the fact that there's only a very small hole for food and water to get into the disposal.  It's not safe to push the food past the rubber splash guard when the disposal is running.3.  When it was first installed, it was VERY QUIET.  Three days after it was installed by the plumber, I turned it on, there was a loud bang, and now it makes more noise and the motor makes a grinding noise, even when there's no food in the disposal, just running water.4.  The plumber installed the disposal and the serial number is not visible from the front.  I called Waste King - this disposal is supposed to have a 10 year warranty.  Without the serial number, they will do nothing.  So if you buy one of these, WRITE DOWN THE SERIAL NUMBER IN THE BOOK.  I plumber won't come back to crawl under the sink to see the serial number without charging me.I would remove this disposal and return it to Amazon but I really don't want to have to pay a plumber $200 to remove this and install a different one.The only good thing I can say is I think it's grinding up the food.  I may have to cut the rubber splash guard so that water and food can go down the drain.  My 22 year old Sears Kenmore disposal worked fine and had no problems.  I only replaced it because I put in new countertops and figured if I had to pay a plumber I might as well put in a new one.  The old Sears model was loud (they didn't have much sound insulation back then), but water went down the drain with no problem, food went down the drain, etc.This disposal is a major pain to use.",0,0,0.93369454,0.061926924,0.0043784757

"This is a convenient little battery operated speaker system for iPads, iPhones or other audio devices.  It is not terribly sophisticated. It is battery operated and the speakers connect to the device through a headphone jack instead of a dock.  It works quite well for increasing the audio for one or two people to watcha movie or other video on an iPad but does not really provide enough amplification to use it to listen to music in a mid-size room or for a group of people to watch a video.  The other major issue us that it burns through batteries at an alarming rate.  One major problem is that it does it shut down when you disconnect the audio device from the speakers.  Instead, there is a button on the side that you have to remember to turn off or the batteries will be dead after a few hours.  I frequently forgot to do this and after a few weeks I had spent more on batteries than this is worth.  Because of this and the less than stellar sound, I would suggest looking elsewhere of you want an inexpensive, portable speaker solution for an iPad or iPhone.

"I owned an older Garmin (the non-flat panel version) for a few years and felt it to be a lifesaver on numerous occassions.  In a pinch, I decided to buy the newest model without much review, trusting the brand that has guided me so well in the past.  As you might expect from the title of this review, I was extremely disappointed, especially given the price of the unit and the quality of its predecessor.Pros:- Flat panel display allows the unit to be more portable and less prone to falling off the windshield as the older, heavier models did.- USB connection allows relatively easy updating of maps (though this takes several hours to complete)- Allows for ""Economy Route"" driving, where if you input your car's mileage it will figure out which way saves the most gas.Cons:- Takes an unusually long time (> 2 min) to 'find satellites' initially.  This has been the case in a number of locations in and around New York as well as other states I've traveled to.- Touch display is not precise, often resulting in typos when inputting addresses- ""Traffic"" feature, while in theory should be a 'pro', has not worked at all from my experience.  It's either never correct about where traffic is, or it provides an update when I'm already stuck in said traffic.- Map updates take several hours and Canada maps are not available by default.- Design is much less intuitive than previous models - for example, the volume control (which I use often - turning it down when I don't need as much guidance and turning it up when I need to concentrate in an unfamiliar area) takes 3 touches to get to the volume menu on screen.  Why not leave this as a physical dial like the previous models?- Most people have experienced a situation where the GPS takes you on a strange route to your destination.  The previous Garmin models did this on occassion.  However, this model uses unusual and impractical routes much more frequently.  I have tried various options (Economy gas, Shortest route, Fastest time) but have not been able to get the system to provide the most direct path during a majority of uses.I'm sad to see the Garmin brand fall so low but I cannot recommend this product, especially given its price.",0,1,0.25620133,0.6798748,0.063923866

Second year its them only, but if you've already made a claim their coverage drops by however much they've helped you already.  If the device fails a second time then, no help.  If the value of the device goes up (and I got it in a good Black Monday sale), you are only covered to the value of your purchase price, not for an equivalent replacement.The manufacturer has a reputation to maintain, so if they don't look after you, word gets around.  Sony covers me during their year, to the end of the year or 90 days since a claim if this is longer.  If the product is going to fail, its more likely to do so in the first year, so Square Trade is risking very little for the 10% fee they charge.  Not usually worth it.",0,0,0.5214303,0.3275541,0.15101564
"UPDATE [March 22, 2013]:Seller (EZFindDeals) honored warranty and sent me out a replacement battery pack. I appreciate this accommodation but remain not to like this battery pack. I will probably not purchase this type of battery again. I have paid 3 times the price and have gotten 5 times the longevity which is actually a better deal and also without this undue hassle.UPDATE [March 15, 2012]:I've had this battery not even 6 months and it will not hold a charge anymore. The talk time is barely 15 minutes and it will no longer hold a charge for more than a day or two on standby. I am not happy.Original Review [October 28, 2012):I'm gonna stand neutral at this time...I originally ordered this battery based on the picture showing the ""yellow"" wrapped batteries. I've had good experience with the yellow battery pack. Anyway, I received the white battery pack and contacted EZFindDeals (seller) whereas I was told the picture is generic but they warrant the battery for one year. I am really hoping to get a few years use as I had before with other batteries but, if this one lasts at least one year I will be happy considering the price.I've been using this battery (in my Uniden cordless phone) for a couple of weeks and it's been working fine. With minimal use, a standby charge lasts about week. This is quite acceptable. I've used it a few times during extended calls without any problems...I haven't yet even used it to reach the ""low battery"" beep. Good!Now, the real test is longevity...if this battery does last beyond a year, I will upgrade my rating. I'll remain optimistic.If you want to know my on-going experience, please comment and I will respond.",0,0,0.9523397,0.042823218,0.004837067
"Finally found a charger that doesn't wipe out the radio with static! We sometimes have to use the 12v outlet in our travel trailer to charge our phones, but the several chargers I've tried before this one all caused so much static on the radio that we couldn't listen to the radio and charge our phones at the same time. With regular USB 2.0 cables, our Galaxy Note 3 phones charge and the radio sounds fine (although you may have to adjust the charger or cables a bit), although it's static-y with USB 3 cables. It's a relief to have a charger that doesn't interfere with the radio.Update one week later: Tried to use it this weekend, it didn't work. The pretty blue light that says it has power is on, but it won't charge the Galaxy Note 3 with either a USB 3 cable or a USB 2 cable and won't charge my Kindle PaperWhite with a USB 2 cable.

"This drive has been rated by a PC enthusiast magazine as the best of the best. I installed the OCZ Vertex 2----120 GB series solid state drive and windows 7 immediately loaded and installed. As noted with these SSD devices. It was crazy fast in every thing it did--- Install programs, launch programs, boot up  and shut down. Amazon promptly  shipped on 9/15/2010 and on 1/20/2011 I got the  message--- drive not found please specify drive or insert boot-able media or drivers. This happened while on line. One minute it was fine the next gone. On alternate boot ups is would appear in the BIOS and on the next it was gone. When I finally quit trying to repair it and tried a clean install--- the installation disc could not find it. I do not think three months and two weeks is a satisfactory service life of any thing no matter how well it works. I should have listened to all those who had DOA or early failures. I now have the 128 GB Crucial C300 series SSD installed and it is running fine. I sure hope this one being made by a major memory company will last better.1-31-11 OCZ does offer a three year warranty on their SSD drives. It took just under three weeks to get a new drive.  You need to go to their site and search under customer service and select RMA and send an e-mail describing the problem. A day or two later they up grade your status from received to in process. You then need to furnish info about your computer--mother board, memory and memory settings, voltage ranges, ETC. It seems that they want to insure that you did not burn it up in the process of over clocking.I did not over clock my computer at all. It was plenty fast with this drive. Once you e-mail that back in a couple of days they approved mine for RMA. You then need to wrap it in bubble wrap, put in a copy of their authorizing e-mail and a copy of the invoice. This invoice is easily obtained from your purchase history if you bought from Amazon. If you do not put the RMA number on the outside of the box they throw it away and you are out of luck. I wrote RMA and the number on each side of the box. You ship it to California and they ship a new one. At each stage there is a time limit that you must respond before or the RMA process is terminated. They are responsive in replying and up grading the process each step of the way.The one thing that I have done that I find helpful is to create a three ring binder for each computer. I get plastic sheets that fit the binder and have a pocket to hold sheets of paper. I put the mother board manual in one page, the info for each item installed in the computer typed up on a sheet, any info that came with the various components, and the invoice receipts for each item. This is easily acquired at Amazon. If I find binder sheets that hold DVD discs it will also put the driver discs in the binder.",0,2,0.289209,0.1145213,0.59626967

"I use IR headphones at home and own six pairs (two different brands). I got interested in XO Vision IR620 because they were available for less than $10 on amazon AND are foldable. The quality of mechanical design is, actually, quite good (compared to other sub-$30 IR headphones), however, to my great disappointment, I discovered that the high-frequency cut-off is uncomfortably low. I know that IR is not for audiophiles and, also, IT headphones are normally marketed to the ""live, eat and sleep in your car"" crowd, but IR has been working fine for me in quieter environments also (for as long as the transmitter can do high-power signal without too much distortion :)).

"This product was relatively easy to use.  You install the driver and then the Cyberlink Media Suite software (the Serial is on the CD itself).  You plug in your camcorder using the necessary RCA composite cables (not included), launch the software, go to the video section, then to advanced video editing.  From here I usually select the Full Feature Editor and from there go to the Capture section.  Play your video, then hit the record on the application.  That's pretty much it.The problem I have is that at times, the video will go berserk, ie. it will look like it is loosing track for a second, look distorted, and then come back to normal.  I thought it was my camcorder.  Or a cable problem.  But when I connected the camcorder to the TV using the same cable, the video played fine without jumping around.  I'm still waiting for Avermedia to respond to my email in regards to this.  I have also tried with 2 different computers but both running Windows 8 which this product is supposed to be compatible with.  If I can't get this resolved, I might as well return the unit and get a more expensive capture device.UPDATE: Upon further investigation I found out that the jumpy distorted video only displays when the camcorder is being used to record while it is moving, for example you are recording something as you walk with the camcorder.  In other words if what you record is with the camcorder on a tripod or some other steady position, you will not get any distorted capture with Avermedia.  But if you are like a normal person using a camcorder, you will get distortion.  Again this does not happen every second you are moving but it does happen with enough frequency to be annoying.  I believe it is the hardware.  My dad's pinnacle system captured the same frames flawlessly, unfortunately I could not use that because of some other issue with the capture freezing probably due to incompatibility with my Windows 8.Here was Avermedia's actual response:Please note that our device and software requires camcorder to be in stationary position during recording, this is to make sure that recorded video will be in sync and don't flicker.Our device doesn't support TBC function (time base corrector) therefore whenever it is capture source device is moving this will be translated into flicker or video-audio out of sync issue.The same issue is with some older video tapes, when the tape is played too many times the video heads may protrude slightly from the spinning head drum. As the head strikes the tape and begins it stretches the tape a tiny amount then springing it back. Because of this stretching and springing back the tape some lines will be shorter, some lines will be longer than they should be. This kind of time distortion may causes the severe time base or sync jitter.From this reason we recommend to fix camcorder in stable position before start capture.At least because their support was willing to work with me, I give them a 2 star rating as opposed to 1.UPDATE 4/16/2013: I bought a Toshiba DR430 DVD recorder on ebay for $69 new and tried recording my problem videos using the DVD recorder.  It transferred flawlessly.  No video distortion or jitter.  Now I can use a program like Handbrake to rip the DVD to a video file.  This is a 2 step process but it's probably better this way since I also am creating a DVD backup of my 8mm tapes.",0,2,0.022654692,0.27626386,0.70108145

"I ordered one of these HDMI Cables (from this page) Dec. 2009 (according to my order history).  When trying to figure out why there was No Picture at all, I realized that this cable had developed a really bad short.  One of the wires obviously came completely undone somewhere inside.  For this thick of a cable, this is inexcusable, so I had to give it 1 Star.Infigear and Mediabridge are the best HDMI Cables I have found for a great price.  Here is a Review I wrote for Infigear...AMAZING Price considering the Identical Quality to Mediabridge Cables!, May 31, 2012By Jeff N (Oakdale, CA)This review is from: InfiGear Ultra Series High Speed HDMI Cable (6 Feet) - Supports Ethernet, 3D and Audio Return [Latest HDMI Standard] (Electronics)This is a new company and the price will probably go up, so STOCK UP NOW!!Comparisons between InfiGear and Mediabridge and Freeport OPPO HDMI Cables...I tested the InfiGear HDMI Cable against the Mediabridge, and the Freeport cable that came with my OPPO Blu-Ray Player.THE RESULTSThe Freeport cable that came with the OPPO Blu-Ray Player is a tad thicker than the Mediabridge and the InfiGear cables. And it has those Ferrite Bead cylinders near the ends that reduce EM and RF interference. No other HDMI cable I have seen has those Ferrite Beads.It was no surprise then that the OPPO cable was a bit better than the InfiGear, but only by about 3%. The picture through the OPPO cable had 3% more detail and 3% more color.The picture through the InfiGear was identical to the picture through the Mediabridge however.HOW I TESTEDBoth my receiver and my OPPO Blu-Ray player have two HDMI outputs, and my LG HDTV has two HDMI inputs, so I was able to simply use the remote to switch back and forth from one Input to the other.THE DISCS I USED FOR TESTINGI decided to use a DVD that has a bad picture when played on my old but very good Sony Carousel DVD Player, and a Blu-Ray with a great picture on my new OPPO Blu-Ray player.For the bad picture, I paused a scene from season 3 of Lost In Space where Will and his mom are standing in the doorway of the Jupiter 2 talking. The scene had humans for skin tones (the most difficult color to get right). The obvious angles of the doorway (another area of difficulty). And other things and details I am familiar with. I expected the better cable to help a little, but there was no difference in picture quality on this DVD through any of the three cables.For the good picture I paused a scene from Charlie St. Cloud where he's talking with his brother at the beginning of the movie, and Charlie is wearing a medal on a ribbon with obvious angles. So again, human faces and hair, and angles, and other things and details that test a picture well.MY EQUIPMENT55"" LG 55L W5600 3D HDTVOPPO BDP-93 3D Blu-Ray PlayerSony DVD Carousel DVP-NC80V",0,2,0.03592988,0.048935533,0.9151346
"UPDATE:  Add one huge con to the list.  The player doesn't support m3u playlists.  I'm not sure what to do now to create playlists, but for craps sake, how could they mess this up?!?One day I thought to myself, ""They should make a cheap mp3 player that you can put a micro SD card in to increase the capacity.""  Low and behold I found the Sansa clip.  Back in the day I had a 5th generation 30Gb ipod that cost me $300. The Sansa clip with a 32Gb micro Sd card does everything that old ipod did, and it cost me 1/5 as much.Pros:- It's very small and light.  If dropped, it is light enough that the player doesn't come out of the headphones.- The screen is bright and easy to read.  I'm glad I didn't play the extra 10 for the color LED version.- If feels well built.  There is a satifying click whenever I plug in my headphones.- The clip on the back is really handy.- Scrolling through menus is quick and responsive.  No lag, even with my fully loaded 32Gb micro SD card.Cons:- After disconnecting from the computer, it takes 10-20 minutes to rescan all the files on my 32 Gb microSd card.  However, after this initial scan, you can turn the player on and off and it doesn't need to rescan.- The player doesn't play m4u type files (native to itunes), so I had to convert all of these files over.- When I navigate to a genre I can only play by the artist, or play all.  I would like to be able to navigate to a genre and the select an album within that genre  This is convenient for multi-artist albums like soundtracks.DISCLAIMER:  Just so you know, I am a real person, and am not connected in any way to a manufacturer or retailer of this product.

"My roommate used to have the WRT54G many years ago and I loved it. When I moved I got a $20 D-Link router which I also loved. After a while we got 2 Acer Laptops and one of them was not compatible with the D-Link. Well I thought it was time for an upgrade anyway and I was gonna buy the WRT54G again. When I got to the store I saw this one and said: Why not!!! Sounds high speed and its Linksys!!! I had it for a few month and then we moved. After we moved my Laptops would constantly connect to one of my neighbors unsecured wireless connection called Belkin. The signal strength was low and to this day I still don't know who's got the Belkin in my neighborhood but their internet always works!!! LOL! So at times I was able to just switch back to my network but other times it would not connect back to my router and I had to reboot the router and sometimes my laptop. This happened with all our laptops. Then sometimes they would connect again but with limited connectivity. So I was connected to the router but the router was not connected to the internet. I work from home and let me tell you my neighbors Belkin router saved me from dropping shifts at work many times since I could not get online through my router unless I power cycled the modem, router, and all of my 2 laptops.In Feb 10 I decided to get a new Desktop and it was Win7. Tried to set up the router and of course the set up CD did not work. So I searched the Cisco website for the Set Up Wizard download for Win 7 and I could not find it although I had downloaded it in the past. So I chatted with customer support to get that link to download the set up wizard to set my router up on my brand new win7 desktop and guess what they said!!! The router is out of warranty and in order to help me I have to pay them $60! ARE YOU SERIOUS????? $60 for a link to a download? You gotta be kidding! For $60 I get 2 new routers. So I went out to get a new one that evening and unfortnately the only router available at Walmart at that time that said it was compatible with Win 7 was the Linksys WRT120N. So I got it and its even worse than this one. Not sure what happened to Cisco since they got rid of the WRT54G routers but after 2 routers that needed to be reset constantly I can not recommend any Linksys products to anyone!",0,0,0.6017545,0.27682456,0.12142088
"The size is right and the plastic material is solid, but the connections seem loose - which is the most important thing IMO. I'm using the standard jumper wires with a small pin on both ends and a wire in between. The jumpers work great in the really old boards I have from Radio Shack, but they are loose in these boards. I have not had continuity problems yet, but am doing some complex multi-board prototyping for a robot, and worry that the slightest bump will disconnect a jumper.

"I ordered the Jambox because most of the reviews listed it as a top performer and it looks nice enough. When I received it the packaging was in perfect condition (like almost all orders from amazon) and set up was easy with my Samsung GSIII. The issue I had was that songs with a decent amount of bass (any hip-hop/dance) made a rattling/static noise as if one of the speakers had a tear in it or was coming loose. The unit puts out a lot of bass and even shakes and slowly moves if it is on a smooth flat surface.I returned the unit and after listening to almost all the choices for bluetooth speakers out there at a BestBuy I have come to the conclusion that for sound the JBL Charge is the best sounding (but $150 and no speakerphone) and the Jabra Solemate is the best all around (not as good sound as the JBL, but cheaper, &#34;ruggedized&#34;, and speakerphone).",0,2,0.1612174,0.20930977,0.62947285
"Fist off i will say that i got this for free as a promo from the manufacturer to help them market the product. I have owned about 12 universal remotes includes some cheap one 4 alls and two Philips Prontos and this has been the most difficult to set up.I will state that the quality and fit and finish of the Harmony remote is really excellent. My biggest complaint about remotes I have owned are that when you press buttons the plastic flexes causing squeaking sounds the factory remotes on my Olevia and Philips Tv's both do that its very annying.So what are my gripes?#1 the software initially asks for exact model numbers of what it will be controlling. This worked well on new equipment but on my Sony big screen which is about 10 years old it causes issues when trying to switch video inputs. also when trying to get it to work with my Tivo it gets confused and does not send the proper volume signal for the TV. This is TEMPORARILY fixed by hitting help on the remote which ""resyncs"" the software but really never fixes the issue.Ok here is my big compaintsThe remote wants to try to simplify things by creating ""macros"" in order words it combines steps so for me it trys to do the following1. turn tv on2. switch to video 13. selects Tivo tunerbut in reality here is what it does1. sometimes turns the tv on2. switches the tv to the next available input (wrong inoput) and it does this because it can't understand that my tv does not recognize direct links for video 1 vide 2 etc instead my tv changes input every time you press the input button so in reality what the remote is telling the tv to do is switch to the next input which 3 out of 4 times wil be the wrong input.Lastly the software is terribleeverything is based on a survey style web page. Want to make a change? first you answer yes to lets say 1 of 7 questions then that takes you to the next set of questions and so on and so on, which never really gets you anywhere in the end.I wish I had a better product to suggest for you, personally I will stick with my Philips prontos 1 is almost 10 years old the other is about 4 years and both still work great.Lastly i do want to restate I did not pay for this and i'm still sticking to the the fact that it STINKS!Oh last complaintthere doesn't seem to be a power button on the remote just an off button at the top so you really are forced to use the ""activities"" menu to do basic things like turn your tv on.I'm going to give this thing another two hours of labor to try to get it to work will call their tech support to see what they have to say but right now it looks like its going to end up in a junk box",0,2,0.16168791,0.38914865,0.4491635
"An ongoing review . . .Life Expectancy of TiVo DVRs:Sony SAT T-60 for DIRECTV = 6 yearsHughes SD-DVR80 for DIRECTV = 3 yearsTiVo Premiere Series4 for Cable TV = 2 yearsTiVo Roamio for Cable TV = 2 months!For you Southern Californians who may recall the old commercial jingle for Toyota of Orange, I sure wish there was a TiVo of Orange; then, I wouldn't need to make lemonade right now.But, then, I suppose I should blame myself for not heeding my own inner advice and, instead, biting the bullet and buying yet another crappy device from TiVo (see my TiVo Premiere review).Aside: Just to further emphasize the lack of craftsmanship and quality control with TiVo products, I'd like to add that I have also used TiVo's Wireless Adapter. The first overheated, causing it to lose its connection several times a day. To their credit, TiVo replaced it, but the second one lasted only about 2 years. If my TiVo Premiere and this wireless adapter are any indication, it is evident that TiVo products are designed to last no more than two years.When my Sony TiVo DVR began to fail, TiVo's customer service blamed my machine malfunctions on Sony, because they manufactured the DVR. Later, when my Hughes DVR began to fail, TiVo's customer service blamed Hughes, again because they manufactured the DVR. So, who will TiVo blame now? In fact, when my TiVo Premiere began to fail, they covered all their bases by trying to place blame on anything and everyone (besides TiVo, of course); they suspected Time Warner (my cable provider); they suspected Sharp (my television brand); they suspected Netgear, the manufacturer of my router (even when I was connected via an Ethernet cable and no other components connected to the router exhibited any signs of trouble); they suspected Cisco, manufacturer of my tuning adapter, even after it was replaced with a new one; and they suspected Western Digital, who manufactured my DVR Expander. For awhile, I did begin to believe that, perhaps, the DVR expander had something to do with my unit malfunctions, but my TiVo Roamio is not connected to a DVR expander, so I doubt it played a part.So, now, let me detail my issues:TiVo Roamio cannot ""permanently delete"" partial recordings without rebooting the DVR. If I cancel a recording while it is in progress and , then, delete it, or if I delete a program that was otherwise only partially recorded, the program moves to my ""Recently Deleted"" folder. There, when I try to permanently delete the same program, the screen returns after clicking ""permanently delete"", but the program remains in my ""Recently Deleted"" folder. Multiple attempts bring the same results. If I reboot the unit, then return to the ""Recently Deleted"" folder, select the program once again, and click ""permanently delete"", the program finally disappears from the folder and, hence, the DVR. I've wasted plenty of User time and lost much hair trying to figure this one out.TiVo Roamio, unlike the earlier TiVo DVRs, refuses to recognize episodes from a canceled Season Pass as User Canceled. Instead, future episodes of the canceled Season Pass continue to populate the ""History"" list, only with the notation ""Limit Reached"". The insert at the bottom right of the screen indicates ""Not Enough Space""! This occurs even when the DVR indicates the unit as being only 80% full and there are only 2-3 one-hour programs listed in the ""To Do"" list. I recall, with previous machines, the message would state that the Season Pass was canceled. More User time is wasted trying to solve this problem.On multiple occasions, while attempting to set a recording, I have received a popup window, informing me that ""4 shows are set to record at the same time . . . "" but, in that same window, no other programs are listed. And, when returning to the ""To Do"" list for double-checking, I find that there are no conflicts at all during the requested recording time. Still, more User time wasted.TiVo Roamio loves to set phantom recordings. I've encountered programs set to record at random times, without any program information (i.e. title). For example, my ""To Do"" list listed two programs set to record on the same day; one scheduled for 8:01pm; the other scheduled for 9:01pm. The only data listed in the ""To Do"" list were the times I just stated. Unlike normal listings, no title was given for either program. On another occasion, a similar phantom recording appeared and, when I allowed it to record, the phantom recording turned out to be a duplicate recording of the normal Season Pass program that appeared just above it in the ""To Do"" list. And, no, I checked and confirmed that I have only a Season Pass for said program (TiVo would suspect that I had a Season Pass and a Wish List set for the same program.) So, the machine recorded two instances of the exact same episode at the exact same time on the exact same channel. Give TiVo Roamio a gold star! That's just what I need: duplicate recordings filling up - and taking up all the space - on my DVR. Thank you, TiVo!Transferring programs between my TiVo Premiere and my TiVo Roamio is hit-or-miss. During the first couple of weeks after setting up my TiVo Roamio, this feature worked beautifully. Of course, I'm referring to programs that CAN be transferred. In my TiVo Premiere review, I mentioned that I had to decline TiVo's offer of a replacement, since I would lose 90% of my recorded programs because they could not be transferred to the new machine. As it turns out, programs from all but the major commercial networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, CW) can NOT be transferred due to copyright infringement (these include AMC, Lifetime, HBO et al., Showtime et al., Starz et al, etc.). Most of my recordings are from premium cable networks. Still, I was able to transfer my non-copyrighted shows to my TiVo Premiere, so as to reclaim space on my TiVo Roamio. I suppose two weeks was too much to ask of TiVo. The honeymoon ended quickly, as this feature failed miserably, time and again. After more User time wasted, researching the internet and struggling through trial-and-error to resolve this significant issue, I learned that both machines must be rebooted to fix this problem - and, even, then, transfers are sporadic. When they work, they work great. A one-hour show takes mere minutes to be transferred from one DVR to the other. But (and this is a big BUT), when they fail, prepare to finish the night with a bottle of Tequila.I also noticed this curious phenomenon: Every Sunday (and, I am not exaggerating when I state ""Every Sunday""), just before 6pm (when I usually have a couple programs set to record), my TiVo Roamio disconnects itself from my cable TV tuning adapter. I've already replaced the tuning adapter, so I've eliminated it as the culprit. This issue does, occasionally, happen on other days, as well, but for Sundays, you could just about set your clock to it. So, every Sunday, I find myself micromanaging my ""To Do"" list, checking and double-checking every single premium channel and the recordings in progress. (Doesn't this defeat the purpose of TiVo?) Still, it never fails that, every Sunday, the unit acts (indicated by DVR lights and ""To Do"" list) like it's recording ""Homeland"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"", for instance. Then, at each recording's conclusion, neither program appears in ""My Shows"" and, reviewing the ""History"" indicates that the programs were not recorded due to ""No Signal"". And, of course, when accessing those channels, TiVo's onscreen message states that there is no signal and, other than the message, the screen remains black. Again, I must reboot TiVo Roamio, wasting more valuable User time.It does seem that I am rebooting my TiVo Roamio, for various reasons, 3-4 times a week; sometimes, 3-4 times in a single day! TiVo Roamio does wonders for a customer's productivity!Oh, and don't get me started on the ABSOLUTELY USELESS streaming engine. After so many years, one would think they could improve it by now but, evidently, they're not even trying. I'll stick with either my not-so-SmartTV or my Roku device.UPDATED 12/20/13:TiVo Roamio fails to acknowledge cancelation/deletion of Wish List programs. Months (yes, months!) after canceling a Wish List program, future shows related to that item continue to populate the ""History"" list as ""User Canceled"". For example, I canceled my Wish List for ""Dracula"" back in mid-October, as soon as the television series appeared in my schedule and I created a Season Pass specifically for the new TV series. Over two months later, I still see instances of the 1979 film ""Dracula"", and other programs incorporating the word ""Dracula"" into their titles, in my ""History"" list. This makes for a very messy, confusing and cumbersome list. Still more User time wasted.Since the beginning of December (more likely, the end of November), about once every week, I received the soon-to-be-notorious ""C133"" error message, telling me that something is wrong with the TiVo service. During this time, a huge exclamation point icon appears on the screen, while all ""Now Showing"", ""Suggestions"" and other current data are missing from the screen. After spending numerous hours on the internet, researching the problem to see if anyone else has experienced it and, if so, how they resolved it, and after spending even more hours power cycling everything (e.g. TiVo Roamio, TiVo Premiere, cable modem, router, tuning adapter, etc.) off and on, again (as TiVo technicians would have me do if I contacted the ""customer support"" line - even when they know the issue stems from their end), I discovered that I was just spinning my wheels, as the problem originated on TiVo's end). On one particular annoying occasion, this message lasted all night long.TiVo loves to waste User time.UPDATED 2/11/14:So, now, transferring programs from my TiVo Roamio to my TiVo Premiere has become a major annoyance. EVERY TIME I wish to transfer a recorded program, I must - IN THIS ORDER - unplug (a remote controlled restart isn't sufficient) and reboot my TiVo Roamio, wait 10 minutes for it to restart completely until it loads the home menu; then, I must unplug and reboot my TiVo Premiere, wait 15 minutes for it to restart completely and load the home menu. Trying this in the reverse order (i.e. reboot Premiere, then Roamio) or rebooting both machines simultaneously (or, even rebooting one just a minute or two after the other) resulted in the original problem presenting itself again: the blue light that indicates a transfer does not appear on the DVR, though the To Do list indicates that the program is ""currently being transferred"". Hours - even days - later, the To Do list indicates the same but, in My Shows, the ""transferring"" program remains at 0:00 and clicking ""Play"" only brings up a black screen on the television. Once I perform this ritual, interestingly enough, the first transfer I request will start immediately (with blue light on) and takes about 3-5 minutes for a one-hour program. I can set transfers, while the first transfer is in progress, to follow immediately after the first transfer has completed. After that session is closed, however, if I choose to set up another transfer later that same day, I must perform the same reboot-cycling ritual yet again! How's that for productivity?UPDATED 4/3/14:Can someone explain why my TiVo Roamio indicates that the season premiere of an upcoming show, just 10 days away, is ""not currently available"", while my TiVo Premiere, connected to the same network, has already added it to my ""To Do"" list? I keep trying to set a season pass for this program on my Roamio, but it won't let me, and the show will be on in 10 days! I'm no longer using the Premiere to records shows, because it is on its last leg and, hence, unreliable. I just wait until I set up each season pass on my new Roamio before I delete the old season pass from my Premiere. That's how I keep track of my previous season passes and upcoming premiere episodes, so I can ""transfer"" the season passes from my Premiere to my Roamio.Also, I now have to repeat the above (see ""UPDATED 2/11/14"") procedure EVERY TIME I want to transfer a show from my Roamio to my Premiere. EVERY TIME! Even if I'm transferring one show immediately after another! So, although it takes only about 3 minutes to transfer the show, it takes an additional 25 minutes to prep the machines.UPDATED 5/30/14:Yet again, similar to the issue in my 4/3/14 update above, some months ago, when the upcoming program was initially announced, I added a wish list for the Starz series ""Power"". I have been checking and double-checking my wish list for the premiere date and, as recent as earlier this week, the only upcoming programs listed were shows with the word ""power"" in their episode titles. Well, I just discovered that the show is to start airing June 7 - next week - and less than 10 days away.

"Since most of the reviews on these have been positive, might as well drop my very quick, negative review into the mix. Purchased these for a cheap headphone to use with the television. Not expecting anything stellar or amazing--and I won't even start comparing these to my audiophile quality cans. Actually they don't even sound all that bad, fair bass, good mids, highs are on the bright side; good sound in general. The cord is a long twenty feet, and they are comfortable. Volume control is a nice add-on. Cheap too, you can go to your local Target and only have to drop $20 for these things. The only annoyance was that the headband adjuster moved around all the time. Otherwise, these headphones were great and served a purpose. But after some time I realized why they are so cheap; because they ARE cheap. Two weeks into purchase and the right channel dies. No explanation--I certainly wasn't giving them a hard time. Returned them and got a new pair. Two, maybe three weeks later, and the right channel dies. Again, no idea why these Philips headphones keep giving out on the right side, but two out of two pairs did this in about the same amount of time.

The keys are now way too 'mushy', and the space bar is a bit iffy. It can take a considerable amount of force to register a press, and I sometimes have to backspace because of it. It also makes a loud, annoying clacking sound when pressed. I'm not at all happy with this new model, and may have to go searching for alternatives.",0,0,0.67553747,0.2852102,0.039252345

"Several years ago I used Corel Visual Studio X3 for editing videos. Then I switched to Apple for five years and used Adobe Premier Elements. Coming back to Windows after my Apple experiment failed, I needed a new video editor, so I was happy to see Pinnacle Studio HD on the Amazon Vine program.My first two attempts at installation failed with errors, but after rebooting my PC it installed okay. My plan was to start with a very simple task - trimming both ends off a video. Most important, I wanted to do it without reading any documentation, because I think simple tasks should be simple to do. I spent a couple of hours working on it, but ultimately failed.After figuring out how to load a video and then placing markers at the places I wanted to trim, I was stuck. I could not find the appropriate tool. Pinnacle has tabs for all kinds of effects: transitions, sound effects, menus, and others. If someone wanted to make a movie with all kinds of special effects, I think pinnacle could do that job. But to do the simple task of trimming the ends off a video, I finally had to resort to the documentation.The section on trimming is on page 80 of the manual. It refers to menus and features that I was unable to find by clicking all over the Pinnacle window for quite a long time. For this review I had neither the time nor desire to read the first 100 pages of the manual to achieve a simple effect. I usually want to do simple tasks like trimming and cleaning up videos, so Pinnacle Studio is probably not my best personal solution.My conclusions:ProsPinnacle Studio has many available effects. Although I did not try any, if you want to make a movie with scenes that spin or flip and exotic transitions between clips, photos, and other clips, it might be worthwhile to look at the program. It appears to me that the emphasis in the software is the special effects.ConsThe two failed attempts at installation on my Windows 8.1 64-bit PC were discouraging, but it did finally install.OverallMost important, Pinnacle Studio is not user-friendly software. If you're not willing to read the first 100 pages of the 389-page manual to get started, I can't recommend the program. But if you're prepared to spend some time reading and learning, and if special effects are your goal, perhaps Pinnacle Studio would be worthwhile for you.",0,2,0.08452291,0.23592266,0.6795544

"Don't get fooled by the product's attracive name. First of all, it's a bit small for my hands (and my hands are somewhat small for my height 6'0&#34; or ~184 cm), which makes it great for travelling but not for home use.

"I was surprised to find this keyboard so difficult to get used to. I've been through several keyboards lately, including some older ones with deep key action, and yet even those old PS-2 connector boards had a feel to them that you could understand and adapt to. This Amazon board is, in a word, sterile. It has promisingly low keys, but their action is nonetheless deep, and so nondescript that your fingers never really develop confidence in what their doing. It's about as close as you can get to typing on a flat piece of wood with no tactile feedback. Consequently I have found increased finger fatigue, a rate slowdown, and an immense increase in errors.I'm not opposed to the board's permanent slight tilt, as I would have invoked it anyway were it on retractable legs. The board's finish is high gloss, and that's nice for about one day. After that you begin to see every particle of dust, and the surface proves to be a serious fingerprint magnet - something you would think a keyboard, of all things, would be designed to avoid.The six extra keys - media player, explorer, 3 volume, and calculator - are well-thought out and work excellently. Under Win7, no dedicated drivers were needed for this board, but that means the special keys are not programmable. The three indicator lights are distributed out to their respective keys, which is a novel space-saving approach, but probably not as useful to the user as having them aggregated in one place.In all, this could have been a great board for just a little more attention paid to the key action, and secondarily the glossy finish. These were mistaken design/marketing decisions that were wholly unnecessary. As it is, this will be a temporary board until I can find something better at reasonable cost.Update, 11/17/2013I did continue to use the original board, and gradually it grew on me. But about a year out the space bar began to fail. It had to be struck dead-on in order to register. Finally I decided to replace the board with the same model.The new one came in and looked great. But then I discovered the Tab key was hard to press. Back the board went for a return/replace. Now I have the newest board, and after two days the space bar begins acting up again. I wish I could attack a pic showing one side of it pressed all the way down, with the bar pivoting in the middle and its other side high in the air.This really could be a great board. But clearly the engineers have pushed cost control on it too far. It simply is not reliable.",0,0,0.71776015,0.2546023,0.027637549
"This is a disaster at every level.  The main problem is the Kindle shuts off constantly while in this case.  It is WAY over-priced.  This has the look and feel of faux leather.

The device does not fit securely into the cover.Now I see the return window for this has closed.  Apparently you have one month to return.

"Dell would blame Windows 8 for their declining sales, but that's far from being the entire story. If Dell wants people to buy their computers, then they need to first look at the package they are currently offering in comparison to what the other brands are providing. My recent purchase of an i15R Inspiron was rather disappointing from the very start until finally having it shipped back to the supplier. I simply could not complete anything I tried to do with it. It has no User Guide to reference, nor could I even complete a back up of the factory restore provision to my DVDs. That&#8217;s not all.Although comments about Dell are favorable in regard to their follow-up support, some new innovation in design is what is really on order. Other brands do quite well by first making sure that the purchaser has the complete package delivered to them from the get-go, and then having sufficient resources readily available for doing some good old fashioned research and updating. In a comparison of the rather uninspiring Inspiron to the latest offerings from other brands, a Dell can't bend over backwards, twist, or even resemble the Star Ship Enterprise, but it did leave me with a lasting impression of opening up a tackle box instead of a state of art laptop computer.",0,0,0.9329126,0.059353504,0.0077338517

"If you're considering purchasing this drive, you should be aware of the tradeoffs involved in trying to use it.On paper the drive looks great. I really wanted it to work. In reality, it is designed so that you can't actually make use of all of its features at the same time.The drive's features are a USB hub, high power port for charging an iPad, Firewire 800 port for higher speed disk I/O and LED indicators on the front to show you how space has been used.If you connect the drive via USB, the ""high power"" port for charging your iPad reverts to low power and your iPad will tell you that it's not charging (it will actually still charge, albeit very very slowly). If you do not connect the drive via USB you (obviously) will not be able to utilize the additional USB ports. You will be able to charge your iPad quickly but you will not be able to sync it via USB.So you get to choose - either fast charging for your iPad or usable USB ports.If you want to use the Firewire 800 port for better disk performance, you can't also use the USB port. If you connect both, the drive will randomly switch between Firewire and USB when your computer sleeps and re-awakens. If you're using the disk for Time Machine your backups will randomly fail.So you get to choose - higher speed disk access or usable USB ports. Of course if you opt for higher speed disk access you'll also be able to charge your iPad faster. You just won't be able to sync it.Finally, the software that controls the LEDs on the front of the drive is rather poor and doesn't hide itself. So you'll always see the Mac Companion software when you're switching between applications.You're better off buying a 3TB external drive and separate USB hub and saving yourself a bunch of $$$. The drive looks beautiful, it's true, but it's hard to understand why Iomega thought that these tradeoffs were acceptable.

This is despite the fact that for them even to come to my house I had to send them pictures.  Second Samsung forces them to replace the processor board because it is cheaper than the screen even though the technician was quite positive it was the screen after the first visit.  When that failed then they are allowed to replace the screen on a 3rd visit.  The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that because of my HORRIBLE experience Samsung agreed to a 1 time warranty extension and paid for the nightmare to end.

"While JVC seems to offer the only real choice right now in DVHS recording (the Mitsubishi DVHS VCRs are not compatible with DTheater tapes), this is definitely on the &quot;bleeding edge&quot;.HDTV recording can only be performed from an incoming iLink (FireWire/1394) connection. There is a single HDTV component output, but no HDTV component input.On the plus side, JVC includes DV-&gt;MPEG2 transcoder circuitry, allowing you to connect a DV camcorder and record on MPEG2 (although I'm still not sure why you wouldn't leave it in its native, smaller tape DV).In my case, the JVC properly registered on my Mitsubishi HDTV (with HomeLink), but NOT as a recordable device. So, no way to record - only playback.As a regular SVHS VCR, you can find much better for a fraction of the cost. Cable box control only goes up to channel 199, so not much use in the digital cable markets. There is no ability to control input audio level.Unless you absolutely need DTheater playback, or you know this will work with your HDTV, then save your money and wait for the technology to solidify.",0,2,0.0112470575,0.058473397,0.93027955
"I bought these right before flying to South Africa to study abroad. They were brilliant on the plane and for the first few weeks, offering rich sound quality that dominated the power of other earbuds that I've owned, not to mention excellent noise isolation. I mostly listen to heavy bass electronic music and use them with my laptop to watch tv and whatnot, and they performed really well (although the highs are arguably masked by the powerful bass) They look unique and are obviously well crafted, with the long braided Rasta colored cord as a great added touch.Why did I give them one star then? Because after two weeks in South Africa one of them stopped working. If you kind of pinch the cord right where it plugs into a device then you can get both of them to work, but there's no way to secure them like that. Suddenly these headphones, double the price of the typical 20 dollar pair that I would buy, were useless and I had to fall back on the tinny crap that is iPod earbuds. The cable did not fray and the pair was taken care of very well, and yet they broke. I'm willing to entertain the possibility that my pair was just defective and the majority are fine, but I still wanted to make it public that they were crap in my case.",0,0,0.49614033,0.17561017,0.32824948
"I bought this on impulse from Walmart after a good transmitter that I had broke.  I had read the bad reviews but got this anyway as it's all Walmart had and I wanted one right away.  It does work but you may have to spend a long time looking for a station and even then you will still probably have some static.  For me, it's been pretty much like listening to an FM radio station in the car where you're almost out of range of the station and there's a bit of static jumping in and out but it's still listenable.  I usually use this to listen to a podcast so it might be a little better if I was listening to music.  I've read that the antenna for the thing is in the short audio cable, so using an extension cable might help, but I only really tried that quickely once and it didn't seem to help.As far as battery life, I dunno how strong the batteries it came with were, but I had to replace them after about 4 hours of use I think.  I don't think the auto-on feature really works but I'm not sure - I always manually turn it on by pressing and holding the up and down buttons (I probably never waited long enough for the feature to activate).  The auto-off feature is ok though.It is nice that you can set this to almost any station, including the even numbered decimals (ie. 90.2, 90.4, etc.) if your radio can tune to those, and you can preset up to four stations in memory - I think the memory is even preserved when the batteries are out but don't take my word for it.

"I am by no means a professional photographer, but I like to take high quality photos. For the past several years I have exclusively owned Panasonic Lumix FZ series cameras and have loved them. I like DSLR type cameras because they are more sturdy and have more features than point and shoot cameras. My most recent camera was a Panasonic FZ35 that I paid $329 for. By accident I dropped it and it broke. It was still under warranty, but I was told it could take weeks or months to get it repaired by Panasonic's repair company.In the meantime I needed a camera because I am a seller on ebay and I have to take photos of my products. I was in a pinch and borrowed my mom's Canon PowerShot A470. It was a horrible camera! The photos came out blurry, the exposure was way off and my pictures looked dreadful. The only way I could take a decent photo with that camera was if I had a tripod and the photo was taken outdoors. I was desperate for a cheap camera that would take quality photos.With both fingers crossed behind my back, I purchased the Fuji S1800. I saw a few negative reviews stating that the photo quality was lacking. I don't know why, but I chose to ignore them.I was looking for more than just a point and shoot camera and one that was similar to my favorite Panasonic Lumix DSLR type cameras. As soon as I received this one I took it out of the box and fired it up. It was a nice looking camera and was almost identical in looks to my favorite Lumix FZ series DSLR type cameras. The body felt somewhat cheap and plasticky though. I was nervous because I hoped I didn't just waste my money. The pictures came out blurry, dark, grainy and the colors were soft and not vivid.It does have a lot of features similar to the Panasonic Lumiz FZ35, but the quality of the camera is just not up to par with my Panasonic. I know the camera is a lot less expensive than the Panasonic camera I am mentioning, but for the price it should at least take considerably better pictures. I tweaked all the different features, tried all the different menu features and it still did not really make much of a difference. What a shame because I really wanted to like this camera.Also what surprised me is that even the worst cameras will take a decent photo outside. This one was horrible outside and everything came out very dark. I tried adjusting the white balance and the iso settings and it still didn't do much. I also even tried using the flash outdoors in shady areas and everything still had a dark hue.Only in the best lighting conditions will this camera perform well. I must be naive because I thought Fuji made high quality cameras.I am very disappointed to say the least and will never purchase another Fuji camera again.",0,2,0.0028694328,0.0067424215,0.9903882

"We bought this clipper at Walmart for about the same price as it is listed on Amazon.As others have mentioned, the packaging is bad; and when we first opened it up out of the box, one of the clipper attachments was broken.  We immediately exchanged it for a new one.The motor works as expected, but after putting it away and storing the clippers in the case (as is expected), we opened it up again to find another attachment broken.  I believe this is more an issue with the thin plastic walls than it is with the case; you can probably break the tongs off with less than 1 pound of force at the end of the tine.  That is completely unacceptable, and you would expect to see it survive basic handling.I am surprised that Wahl is cost cutting on such a basic element.  Here's an idea; instead of thinning the walls of the plastic to save a quarter penny/each, how about eliminating one attachment altogether, and make it more durable.  A single tine failure is equivalent to the entire set failing, unless you are just shearing sheep.Pass on this one.",0,0,0.8832104,0.10085423,0.01593537

I ordered this hoping all the rave reviews would be my experience vs. the really negative reviews.  I was wrong.  I believe this little device could do all it claims if it can ever be configured properly.  User documentation is a joke and LinkSys HelpLESS desk is not much better.  Was attempting to connect this router to my ISP's router which some reviewers had success in doing with cross over cables and static ip's.  Unfortunately I wasn't one of them.  3 days lost messing with this and Linksys tech support was really weak.  I knew more than they did about their product.  To quote one 'tech' &quot;I'm confused&quot;...duh!  I'm convinced all the calls went to some outsourcer in India to boot so getting through was an ordeal in itself.If you have a very simple setup and don't care too much about security you may be very happy with this.  I can only reason that all the rave reviews by first time non-tekkie users is based on not needing alot of functionality and using device defaults.  But if you need anything more YOU need to know what you are doing because help is non-existant.

"I'm not too happy with this one.  I'll be sending it back because of the problems i'm having.As a few other reviews mentioned - this thing runs red hot.  Its not just the reader either - i've tried it with several readers.  It gets extremely hot to the touch after about 10 minutes of use, and will no longer be recognized by the computer or devices i put it in.  Once it cools down, it will resume functioning.Considering it only has a few simple tasks...  writing to, and reading from memory...  for it to fail at it's core function like this is unacceptable. I use microSD in my phone and cameras exclusively, so i've used plenty.  None get this hot.  Each cool down period is longer and longer.. and each ""working"" period is shorter.

"I was researching ways to boost cell signals when I found this. After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed, easily and permanently, with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data. A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out.  And many live in areas where cell signals are just weak.  But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office. Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago. It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming. It also works world wide on WIFI for $5 a month. Service is unlimited and has no contract. An unlimited call and text plan is $10 a month, and unlimited cell, text and data is $25 a month. You do have to use their phone (Moto X $299 or Moto G $149) because they need Republic's proprietary software to work at these rates.

"Latest update.I filed a complaint with Amazon.Let me explain what I think the problem is.First, of course, the correct product is not being shipped.Secondly, there were no directions on mine.  It turned out, the final white tab to be removed is supposed to remove the entire piece of plastic that covers the protector.  Since the tab tears off without removing the top layer,we think the top layer is the protector.  When I decided to throw the protectors away immediately, I removed the top layer, and didn't realize the remaining layer was the protector. I saw the bubbles and  I thought my screen was ruined.  Then I thought that maybe, the bubbles are caused by a remaining layer.  Again from the bottom, (at the hole), I removed the actual protector.  All the bubbles disappeared.Finally:  I guess there is no such thing as ""IKROSS Screen Protector.""  For some reason, comments on this site indicate it's a name brand.  I googled.  Can't find anything other than these these cheap protectors with various names on them.  Amazon should delete the Ikross name since it seems like every vendor ships their own whatever.Original review.This is the Blue Harbor private label brand.There are two tabs on each piece.  The inside tab removed easily prior to application.The outside tab, which is to be removed after application, would not come off.Now I have a white tab down the upper left corner of the IPOD, which looks lousy.Would not buy again.UPDATE.

My speakers had a key hole and the screw they gave for the key hole didn't work. I needed something a little longer.

"I, too, chose this TV because of the great rating it got on the Consumer Reports website.  The price just keeps on dropping.  I paid about $1240 for it in Feb 2009. It was a great TV and picture while it lasted.  Five months in and all it's good for now is a boat anchor.  No power.  It cycles on and off, and the red light flashes, but that's it.  I tried the troubleshooting guide with no success  I called Samsung and they are sending someone out on their dime to fix it.  Stayed tuned for results of that visit in the comments section here.  One thing I didn't like was that it wouldn't automatically adjust to the picture size it was showing.  My dad's Panasonic had a feature where if the picture format was 4:3 it would adjust after a few seconds to fill up the whole screen.  SyFy and AMC channels show a lot of stuff that is formatted for a 4:3 screen in 19:6 letterbox format On this TV there is a BIG black border around the whole picture.  Getting it to fit on this TV's screen is a nightmare.  Something is either cut off on the sides  or the top and bottom are black and the picture is stretched.  There are two zoom settings, but you can't adjust the size of the zoom, just the position, so you get to choose which two sides you want to cut off.  It does have a cool feature where if the TV is turned off and you have a DVD HDMI connection, all you have to do is load the DVD and the TV turns itself on.  But for now, it's dead.

"I have been looking at a lot of mini Bluetooth speakers very similar to this one and have played with a lot of them, so i know what a good mini Bluetooth speaker should be capable of without any unreal expectations.  From reading all the great reviews on amazon I had high hopes for this speaker, I expected this to be a keeper but instead I am returning this speaker with no regrets.My first thoughts on this speaker was that it had a very unique design, which I liked, the build quality seemed to be quite good, and it had a bit of weight to it which is nice.  Bluetooth pairing was very easy and once I got it up and running, I started playing some music on my playlist, and noticed immediately that this wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be.  The sound coming from the speaker was muddy and muffled.  The highs were a bit sharp and harsh making listening to music a bit painful on my hears.  The volume gets to a decent volume but not quite as loud as other similar speakers I have used. This speaker does have pretty good bass for speakers of this type, but it doesn't make up for everything else that it's lacking.Overall I was dissatisfied with this speaker, the sound quality was just not there.  If you do not plan on listening to a lot of music, or plan on using it as a speaker phone for phone calls, or just don't care to much about sound quality and just want a speaker to amplify sound then this will work just fine, but there are better bluetooth speakers out there for about the same price.",0,2,0.14750932,0.19830592,0.6541847

"I purchased these for working out and wearing while napping, not for serious listening.  So my expectations, based on the lush reviews, was for a real value-treat.I'm sorry, but I have to totally disagree with all the rave reviews, these don't cut it.  At all.  They appear well built and are great to look at, I'll give them that.  I *WANTED* them to sound good.  But they don't.  They sound awful, unless all you like is solo acoustic guitar.These have very weak bass below 100Hz (yes, I know all about having a good seal, and I did), no highs above 5,000Hz, horribly stiff cables with shape-memory, and after just a couple of months, my right ear driver tore (and I'm not a volume freak).  For really mid-heavy music, these can sound very mellow, with not much distortion, but the lack of top end just makes them dead boring on any other music.I have to laugh at the marketing hype on these: silver cables.  I mean, who the heck cares when there are no highs!In the price range, the Apple balanced armature IEMs simply blow these away, if you can get a good fit, as do the Sennheiser CX500.  While neither is ""high end,"" both at least cover the full frequency spectrum.Unfortunately, all devices in this price range have some shortcoming that is pretty severe, and they never last long.  I have had about 15 different $50-$100 IEMs for super casual use, and while none ever made me want to stop shopping in the class, these were the most boring of them all.  I spent a bit more and upgraded to the Atrio Future Sonic, it's 2.5x the price, and worth it if you can afford it.  Well built, good looking and sounds fine.  I won't trade in my JH16s for them, but I am pleased enough to not bother with other IEMs for a while.Think twice about what kind of music you listen to before you buy these.  If you're into rock, electronica, or anything with a bottom-end or energy up top, these are just wrong (I'm not a bass-head, but I care about balanced, deep bass).",0,0,0.9563014,0.040711384,0.0029872223

"Really not very well made and not packaged very well.  I'm not sure why all the 5 and 4 star reviews.  A lot of people must have low standards or just lack experience with other products.  (I tend to think the fellow who said &#34;Chinese junk&#34; had seen a lot better for the money as have I)  I bought a Dayton Audio mount for about the same price not long ago and it is night and day heavier and more sturdy than this mount.  (and all the hardware was powder coated black to match, not the cheap stuff this comes with)  All these people that cut it down should have just got one of the heavier ones that was already shorter and more sturdy and had better hardware.  This thing is pretty light sheet metal.  It was also packaged pretty lightly and the main pole was scratched on arrival.  If it was going in my house I would send it back.  That said, I think it will serve my purpose and hold the TV I plan to put on it.  I expected after reading the reviews that the build might not be what my other mount was.  I bought it to hold a 55 or 60 inch TVA in an exercise room in a building I am having built.  (ground not even broken on that yet so this is an advance purchase to help me plan ahead on mounting details)  The room will have 10 ft ceilings and after a lot pf pondering I was still not certain exactly how high I am going to want it and this thing has a  wide range of flexibility in hanging height which is hard to find.  That is the main reason I bought it and why I will keep it.  This way I can have the electrical and video line boxes mounted in the ceiling where I want it and adjust the height as needed.  It's not a great design in that it does not allow you to run cables through the top of the mount either (I knew that already from other reviews though) but since I'm having something built I can work around that.  For a retrofit that would be more bothersome.  I'm running cat5 cable and using baluns for video so I'll just have a keystone box/plate in the ceiling with a cat5 jumper run to a video balun.  The cat5 and power should be easy enough to route through the pole from the box.  I was tempted to give it a 3rd star jut because it has the wide height range but overall I think that is being a bit too generous in the evaluation since the build quality is questionable.  For the combined price with shipping (which was quite high) you can do much better if you do not need the wide height range.",0,0,0.8674652,0.12691711,0.00561768
"I've had this television since the first week of January 2009 and I am SO disappointed in this TV.  First of all, it doesn't have closed captions on mute, indeed no CC at all unless you connect the cable directly to the TV (as opposed to through a DVR, cable box, DVD player, etc.)  Who has a gargantuan TV and DOESN'T have those other things???  To me, CC is about as basic a feature as one could expect.  Secondly, after many hours of phone consultation with both Panasonic and Lenovo, I still cannot watch streaming video from my computer.  Thirdly, it doesn't behave properly using the cable remote, so I'm back to using multiple remotes and my husband refuses to even try to learn yet one more stupid electronic challenge.  Every TV in the house is different and this one isn't the easiest one to watch even though it's the newest.Yes, you can view photos via card thingie from camera--ok, but not really better than the laptop.Lastly, I researched this purchase for almost two years.  One of the main reasons I chose this particular model was a few reviews which said ""go ahead and get 720p, you'll never notice the difference.""  Well, even regular TV doesn't look crisp to me(not like the ones in the stores, anyway), so, yes, I think I do notice even though I really am not that particular.  If I'm satisfied watching instantly on Netflix on my cheap laptop, I can't be that discerning a viewer.One problem with research and waiting is that one is more likely to second guess one's choice.  That's certainly me this time.Honestly, I wish I'd just saved the $1000.",0,0,0.9400096,0.05674299,0.0032473993
"I bought a Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N AP before this unit.  That unit worked great, was quite stable compared to the Linksys WRT54G AP it replaced.  The Linksys AP had a problem of crashing whenever the WAN connection (a cable modem) was interrupted for a few minutes or longer and had to be power cycled.  The Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N AP didn't have this problem.  Encouraged by this, I bought this unit of WZR-HP-G300NH.  It is a more expensive model than the first unit but supposedly has the network file server (NAS) capability with an external USB hard drive attached.  It turned out to be the worst AP I ever bought (I had D-Link, Linksys, Buffalo, Netgear APs of various models).  I set this unit up as a WDS station to link with the first Buffalo unit I bought which was set up as a WDS AP.  The biggest problem is that it crashed every hour or so.  When that happened, it would not perform any routing function and could not be accessed through the web interface.  On the WDS AP's client list I could see this unit popping in and out every second.  It had to be power cycled to get back to work for another hour or so before it crashes again.  The second problem is that the NAS does not support the NTFS (Window XP, 7) formatted hard drives, which is virtually the format of all the hard drives sold, only the FAT and the Linux formatted drives are supported.  The problem with the FAT format is that the file name has many restrictions, so lots of Window 7 files can't be copied onto it.  In addition, only the FTP protocol is supported with virtually no security.  The Windows network (SAMBA) protocol is not supported so the drive can not show up as a Windows network drive.  The WDS is also not what it is supposed to be.  I was hopping to use this unit as another AP in a WDS system to extend the first AP.  The description on the Buffalo product suggested that this is possible, even automatic roaming among these different APs is supposedly supported.  But there was no documentation on how to set up and do that.  After trial and error, I was only able to set this unit as a WDS station, not a second WDS AP as I hoped.  This makes this unit essentially an Ethernet bridge connecting only wired hosts (through the LAN ports) to the AP.  I finally had enough and returned the unit after 24 hours.",0,0,0.92366683,0.06324596,0.01308722

"Summary-------This is a very affordable powerline extended. It seems to work well across circuits with different kinds of wiring. When in range wifi performance is good but range is quite limited. Setup can be incredibly frustrating if you desire some control over IP address and device configuration.Plug in the PA211 into a wall socket in the local location and connect the LAN cable.  Otherwise just plug in the WPA-281 in a wall socket in the remote location. If you're luck (like some other reviewers) it'll have the default 192.168.1.1 IP address with admin/admin password. If not you'll need to do a network scan  using scan tools or the powerline scan or powerline utility programs from TP-Link.It's not at all clear how either device assigns itself an IP address or whether and how they make use of existing DHCP servers on the network.The kit I'm reviewing comes with a TL-WPA281 which includes wifi and a TL-PA211 without wifi. Here's some basic terminology that TP-Link uses that will make things easier to understand:""Local"" - the device that's connected to your LAN via an ethernet cable. It makes most sense for this to be the TL-PA211 and to leave the wifi enabled TL-WPA281 for the remote end""Remote"" - the device that is not connected to your LAN but relies on the powerlines. Makes most sense for this to be the TL-WPA281 since it has wifi and can give you a new network in a new locationInitial Setup-------------- I plugged the PA211 into my router and into the wall outlet- I plugged the WPA281 into a wall outlet- It all worked! That was it.Initial Observations--------------------- No security on the new wifi network created by the WPA281. SSID is broadcast- Default password on WPA281 (user ID/PWD: admin/admin)- Can't find either device on the network- Powerline adapter will work *across* electrical circuits which is great. The wiring does not have to share a neutral or anything. Which is great! I plugged one device into a a circuit with arc fault interruptor (no shared neutral) and the other end into an old knob and tube circuit. I was very surprised it workedFurther Observations and experiments------------------------------------TL-WPA281- As I mentioned before, this is the 'remote' device. It is accessible via web GUI- It supports b/g/n wifi and it does not have a DHCP server. It relies on the one on your main router. So when it is not part of a powerline network it will not allow devices to connect- On my network it gave itself a different IP Address Everytime in the range of my network. It did not use my DHCP Server. That was really annoying. When connected locally to a PC it also gives itself a different IP address everytime (in my case in the 169.254.xx.yy) range. Again, very annoying. I tried setting the IP address in the GUI, reinstalling the firmware and factory reset but that did not work. I used Google Chrome browser.- For need to rely on either the ""Powerline Scan"" or ""Powerline Utility"" programs available on TP-Link's website. Either one of those will give you the IP address of the WPA281. Or you can use a network scan utility.- It supports Wifi Protected Setup (WPS) which is enabled by default. The wifi status LED also acts like a WPS button- Wireless range is mediocre (20-30 ft) but performance is good otherwiseTL-PA211- This is the 'local' device. It cannot be accessed via a web GUI. Only through the Powerline Utility program.- You can upgrade the firmware using the ""PowerLine Utility"" program. There are two firmware files needed. My version came with the latest but I reinstalled the firmware and reset it anyway because I was experiencing problems.- It connected to my network (via the ethernet cable) without using my DHCP server. I scanned and sniffed packets and couldn't figure out what it's IP address was (if it had one). I didn't like that but didn't want to waste my time with further investigation.- I was never able to connect to it via a web interfaceUtility Programs----------------There are three utility programs available on TP-Link's website. I never bothered with the included mini-CD because they tend to be out-of-date. Here are the three programs and a brief description:- powerline scan - scans for remote devices only. whether they are connected directly to your PC or on the network. So this would be to find the IP address for the WPA281- powerline utility - remote device, advanced qos settings, update local device firmware- powerline utility setup - could not get it to work on Windows 8 64-bit.

My camera has a huge zoom capability with one lens, I don't travel with a ton of accessories for it, and it's small in comparison with those big cameras, so this pack merely had a lot of wasted space and represented a solution to a problem I didn't really have.  I returned it for a much less expensive, more general-purpose laptop pack from samsonite, which gives me enough space for my camera, laptop, and other stuff and was a much sleeker, nicer pack than this.  This is a decent bag if you do have the big camera and like to bring along a lot of lenses and other accessories, but it is total overkill otherwise.  I'm not even 100% sure about the &#34;camera hammock&#34; system that is this pack's major feature.. it does suspend your camera and allows you quick access from a top pocket, but it seems to me that it could also expose the camera body to some unwelcome bangs and bumps if the pack receives any rough handling.",1,2,0.015229485,0.0685984,0.91617215
"Everki Concept vs. Ogio Renegade RSS vs. Thule 32L Vs. Ogio EpicSo I am super particular about certain things (read my other revises if you don't believe me). I spent a few years looking for the perfect travelers backpack. I tried everything from Burton to Dakine and loved my Dakine, but it was getting a little long in tooth. I've tried all three of these with the sole purpose of finding the best backpack for international travel (pleasure). I usually go on long trips, but have to work while on vacation.I travel with: Nikon DSLR and 18-300 lens. 14"" laptop. Ipad. Chargers. First Aid kit, and small ancillary things (sanitizers, baby powder, adaptors, etc).Price:1.) Ogio Renegade and Epic available at ~$1002.) Thule at REI for $1293.) Everki is $200Construction:1.) Everki is so far beyond these other two it's not even funny. Big HIGH QUALITY zippers. High Quality construction. Felt lined pockets. Leather accents. Comfortable straps.2.) Ogio Renegade is only slightly better than the Thule. The Thule seemed a little too low profile, sleep, and was a stiff material. Ogio zippers were disappointing. I don't think they will last forever.3.) Thule was a little stiff, basic construction, wasn't super impressed.4.)  The Ogio Epic's zippers are pretty weak, and the fabric is a little stiff.  Construction is more like outlet versus store quality.Special Features:1.) Ogio Renegade has tons of pockets. Two sunglass pockets on front which is great because you can put your wallet or phone in a separate container from your sunglasses. 4 side pockets. Super slim felt lined computer pocket (I am not convinced a 17"" would fit in here). And a great front ipad pocket. Even a secret pocket on straps2.)  The Ogio Epic has less side pockets, but has some more interesting uses.  It has an AMAZING external ipad pocket which is great for airplanes.  It's pockets are also laid out better, easier to get into, and more functional.  The side laptop pocket is nice, but I had to deduct a point because the side pocket is not suspended.  If you drop your bag hard, your laptop will suffer. And although it had three mini pockets on the top, none of them were hard shell.3.) Everki has a lay flat system which is AWESOME for going through airport scanners. You don't need to remove your laptop. Computer and Ipad pockets are super padded and well lined (though computer pocket does not suspend computer, which might be a concern if you drop your backpack down a lot. Everki has a giant sunglass case and also a nice large open pocket on the front (good for airplane tickers, or wallet or passport. Though it is NOT secure). Magnetically sealed. It also has a waterproof cover that comes out of the bottom pocket. I don't see myself using this.4.) Thule has a ""shove it pocket"" in the front which is great for newspaper, magazine, or a lunch bag. It is not secure enough for anything else, as the sides are open too. This feature is interesting, but I don't think that useable. Good, hard protected pocket on front for sunglasses, phone etc. Has a nice bottom pocket for chargers, etc.Comfort:1.) The Everki is big, very big, and a little heavy. (4.5 lbs). But is very comfortable to wear. Super nice straps. High quality, comfortable construction. I could wear this all day.2.) Ogio Renegade and Thule are very behind in this department. Thule is very basic straps with stiff construction. The kind of straps you would find on a $30 backpack. The Ogio is the same, which very short straps, that will not fit a larger man unless fully extended. Not super comfortable. Thule is much lighter than the other two. Ogio is about 4 lbs, but also very stiff.  The backpack has almost TOO MUCH padding.3.)  The Ogio Epic is pretty stiff and the straps are a little stiff too.Profile:1.)  The Epic is a nice size.  Deceptively big, but the parts that aren't used seem to compress.  This backpack seems much smaller than it is.  I put a ton in here.2.) Thule is low profile, very thin, with deep pockets.3.) Ogio Renegade is also pretty stiff and will easily fit under plane seat.4.) Everki is bigger than these other two, but also a little bulkier. I think this backpack would be amazing in a 15"" size, as the 17"" is almost TOO accommodating.Pockets:1.) Ogio Renegade has pockets everywhere, and they are well thought out pockets. As I said, dual wallet pockets on the front. Four side pockets. Ipad pocket in front, and even a cash pocket on the straps. Computer case is very hidden, which is great, as you don't need it very often. Ipad is easily accessed. Laptop pocket is well protected and also suspended.2.)  The Epic has a ton of pockets (LOVE THE IPAD POCKET), but as said before, only a few detractors:  Only two side pockets, which are also pretty small.  Laptop pocket is not suspended.  And there is no hard shell pocket.3.) Everki has some amazing pockets, but they are not well thought out. The laptop pocket is massive, padded, felt lined, but also does not suspend. The ipad pocket is also located in the same pocket, which is kind of a pain. That means you have to open up your laptop pocket, which is in the rear, every time you want to access ipad. Front pocket is too narrow to be useful. Sunglass pocket is large, but only one. BIG MISTAKE: NO SIDE POCKETS. There are two, but they are not very useable, and non seal. Magnetic pocket one front is helpful, but obviously not secure. Bottom pocket holds the waterproof cover, but not very useful and makes the bag unstable.4.) Thule has a good hard shell pocket. Other pockets are very deep and narrow. Stuff it pocket is okay, but not secure enough to hold anything other than newspaper or magazine.Straps:1.) Everki- home run2.) Thule/Ogio- tied for last. Both are what you would expect on a $30 backpack. Stiff back. Not comfortable. Ogio straps are VERY VERY short and the adjustment does not hold. This is great if you are 6', if not, beware.Zippers:1.) Everki- amazing zippers. Will last forever.2.) Thule- acceptable3.) Ogio- total junk. I do not expect this backpack to last me more than 1-2 years.Looks;1.) Everki- you could walk into a board meeting with this bag.2.) Ogio Epic- very nice, very subtle.  It's not nearly as boxy as the photos look.  3.) Ogio Renegade- very sporty. Not businesslike.4.) Thule- distinctive, but very sporty too.Warranty:1.) Everki has a lifetime warranty, no questions asked. This combined with their EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY makes them a force to be reckoned with.2.) Thule claims to have a 25yr warranty, but I am not sure the details.3.) Ogio has a limited lifetime warranty, but we all know how valuable those are. Construction on this piece is a little suspect, so we'll see how it goes.In conclusion, I immediately dismissed the Thule. It was a little too thin, and didn't really offer anything extra other than the bottom pocket. I kept the Everki for one trip and was in love with it, but couldn't get past a few things. The lack of exterior side pockets was a pain. The bag was also very big. I travel with a 13-14"" laptop, so I didn't need a bag as big as the Everki. Sometimes it was tight in an airplane. The construction of the bag was awesome, but the rear computer pocket was tough to get into, and I wish it wasn't also shared by the ipad pocket. Ipads needs to be immediately accessible. Front pocket was worthless. The middle pocket however is huge. And I LOVED LOVED LOVED the construction of the bag, the quality of the bag, and the giant zippers. If I were using this for business, it is also very professional looking.For awhile, I liked the Ogio Renegade. I hate the zippers on it, but I like the small, enclosed laptop pocket. I love the dual sunglass pocket (can be uses for phone and wallet too), and I like the side pockets. I love the ipad pocket on the front. I hate the straps and stiff feel of the rear, but couldn't get past the weight and the excessive padding.I ended up keeping the Ogio Epic for a few reasons.  It didn't seem as big and bulky.  The pockets are very well laid out.  The side pocket is nice for the laptop, and the external slide in ipad pocket will be a godsend for planes, etc.  It's a little big lighter too.  I will miss the hard shell sunglass pocket, but it has three others that are nice.  This bag is deceptively big.  I worry about the build quality, but we'll see!!If I could get the Ogio bag with the Everki construction, I would buy 3-4 of them and use forever.Final Pro/Con on Ogio Epic:PROS: Best design. Best pockets. Best layouts. Best size for me.CONS: Shoddy construction. Mediocre zippers. Stiff/bucky padding. Bad straps. Heavy.",1,2,0.0025089106,0.011727955,0.9857632

"There are good and not-so-good points about this portable router.For the positive, it is very small, lightweight and very attractive-looking.On the down side, the instructions that came with this unit are very difficult to follow, do not make sense, and are often contradictory.

"I live 5 miles from the broadcast towers so for the most part almost anything will give me a signal. I've been using a homemade loop antenna near my TV for some time and my only issue was that I was picking up a reflected signal and when cars or trucks occasionally go by it was disturbing my picture.  I had high hopes for this antennta because I could mount it in a window which was actually only 5-10 degrees off from the optimal angle to the towers and at least in a window I didn't have the house materials blocking my signal.  It performs no better than what I had used before, even with this mounted at the window which should be a clearer path to the tower.  Granted there are trees in the path between the towers and this antenna and there isn't much I can do about that.  I was hoping for a bit better performance(eliminating the occasional picture disturbance which seems to occur usually in the evening for some reason)....  It was easy to place in the window and the white cord blends in decently with the paint near the window.  The antenna is black on one side and white on the other.  I would not expect miracles from this antenna but it may allow you better placement with less obstructions by placing in a window compared to other indoor antennas.",1,2,0.05069149,0.15593679,0.79337174

"The sides do not come off as easy as I would hope. For a big box that retails for as much as it does that should have been a given.

"I got this as a Christmas present in December of 2009. In May or June of 2010 I posted a pretty positive review (4 stars) here because at that time the mount was holding up wonderfully doing what I expected it to do. At that time the only negative thing I had to say about it was that the button in the back of the mount that released the clamps was hard to access. I even said in my review that I was so happy I was about to purchase a second one for my wife's car.Now I am extremely happy that I did not buy that second one. In the last 4 months the mount has broken in two places. The first break was a nut-type part that screws down onto the arm to sturdy the mount. Once that broke the mount was pretty shaky and constantly drooping down...however I was able to fix it with some super glue.Now it has broken a second time beyond repair. There is an arm/lever that somewhat clamps the mount down over the suction cup to hold it steady. That lever is what broke, so now the entire assembly shakes and wobbles constantly. I'll see what I can do to fix it, but it appears to be useless now unless I want a wobbly mount.I'm not sure what the shelf life should be for a mount like this, but I don't think it's too much to expect it to last more than one year. We did frequently move the mount from one car to the other, which may have caused some of the damage. If you are planning on putting it in one car and leaving it there you might be fine.",1,0,0.50111556,0.24152386,0.25736058

"I've been running a wireless netowork in my house for over 5 years not strating with a Linksys g router and more recently, a D-Link N router (655 model).  When I got the Netgear, I was hoping that installing it would be easier than the D-Link as I had problems that required some odd configuration settings that were proved to me from the D-Link support area.I ran the CD that comes with the router and followed step by step even though I consider myslef skilled at this type of installation.  The program stated it should take 20 minutes to install. I decided to use the wizard rather than the manual setup because this router is supposed to allow for oone click wireless connection so you don't have to remember long passwords to connect.  After the initial setup, the program took me to the setup page where it spent maybe 2 minutes trying to detect my connection.  A screen popped up and asked if my IP is static or dynamic...now, right there...this router drops its user freindly face and starts to through more experienced issues at the user.If I was someone like my parents that barely have a clue how to use a computer, this question would cause the installation to come to a screaming halt.  For me, I know my IP addres and info which I types in nut I kept getting error messages.  After about 15 miutes of trying to get it to work, I decided to go into manual mode.  From here, I was able to detect my IP automaitically and get everything setup for a hard wired connection very easily.  I then went into the wirelss settings and establised my security tyoe and passcode.  I was now up and running and was able to connect all of my computers (3) and 3 playstaions with no issuesThe speed is no better or worse than my D-Link router.  The strength of the signal from my compter farthest away from the router ranges between very good and excellent so the router does have great range.  It has no external anetnnas yet its able to give me the same range as my D-Link that has 3 of them.I have received no dropped connections yet after 24 hours and I haven't had to recylce the power on either the router or modem (I use Comcast for internet).So, why only 3 stars?  First, while I didn't need to contact customer support, I still ran into problems with the included install CD.  Having to run a manual setup for most is a scary idea so I wwould suggest the less savy computer users stick to brands like Liksys (the only brand I've had no isses with for routers......adaptors are a different story!Second, I can't comment on the push buttong security and connect feature because I couldn't get the wizard to work right.  I am currently using it in the same manner as every other wireless router I've had where I have to type in the passcode the first time I connect.  Not sure how the feature is supposed to work so I have to take a star away from a uselss feature for me under the current setup.Finally, the ethernet connections are not gigabit connections.  While not overly important for most that use older adpators, there are better buys out there for wireless N routers that offer gigbit connections (if my thinking is wrong and this does have gigabit, please leave a comment for me...I just can't find documentation on it anywhere).I have one final test that I need to do which is stream a Netflix movie over my wireless to my PS3 to see how that is handled.  I will post an update IF it is significantly better or worse than my D-Link.As of right now, I will probably switch back to my D-link for the gigabit support.EDIT****  After 48 hours, I have gone back to my D-Link Wireless N router.  Streaming video over wireless using the Netgear gave me choppy video performance compared to my D-Link.  I have a feeling that the D-Link allocates the bandwith to video/audio streams much better than the Netgear so performance isn't affected.  Even with my old G router, I could stream at least 5 minutes before the video would get choppy.  With the Netgear, it was immediate and this was with my PS3 getting a 100% signal.  Very strange!Using a hard wired connection was fine and worked as well as my D-Link but, unfortunately, I an unable to hardwire both PS3's in my house due to locations so I went back to what worked.If you don't plan on using this router for video streaming, it does a fine job with the internet and maintaining connection.  The setup, while not going well for me, seems to be easier than most based on other reviews I've read.  Maybe my setup problems were in the minority.  I would still recommend the D-Link 655 even though it's about $20 more.",1,2,0.045897312,0.09444864,0.8596541

"I've been using this for about a week in my GMC Sierra truck. While it's certainly not the ""truck"" Rand McNally is referring to in their description, I have been wanting to get a larger NAV unit for this vehicle. Most are much smaller and are naturally harder to see on a large dash that's typically a bit further away than your average sedan. So I will be taking into consideration who this is marketed for as we go through this review.HARDWAREThe GPS itself is certainly on the large side as it is a 7"" model. Although since it has been designed to be ""rugged,"" there is extra bulk that you normally wouldn't expect. Both in terms of thickness and bezel around the screen. And I'm not quite sure this extra bulk necessarily adds to any ruggedness as it all appears to be the same plastic/rubberized material.Other than the screen, there is nothing else on the front. You do have the bright orange power button at the top right side, although it does have to be pressed downwards from the top. On the right there is a MicroSD card slot, Audio Out, and Video In, both typical &#8539;"" jacks. On the back is the MiniUSB port and a connector for an external GPS antenna. There is also a slot for the mount.There is also a USB -> MiniUSB cable, DC, and AC power cables. Along with the windshield mount. I should also note that while they are using standard MiniUSB, they have warnings written everywhere to ONLY use the included power adapters.MOUNT & PORTSFirst, the MicroSD slot has no use at this time. It's just there for ""future use,"" as indicated in the manual. And the USB port, which is used for both data and power, is on the back, not the side. If you're using the included suction cup mount, that's not an issue. The problem is that while the included mount is of good quality and has plenty of adjustment, it's way too short. It might work well in a car, but even in my ""normal truck,"" it's way too close to the window unless I mount it high near the visor.This means I have to lean forward quite a bit to use the device. I'd like to use a universal or generic mount that sits on the dash, however the non-standard mount point and rear USB port will make that difficult as it would simply get in the way. They really need to include a mount with an extension on it, or make one available for purchase separately.SCREENThe display itself is very bright and I had no issues viewing even in direct sunlight. It will also automatically switch to night-time driving when it gets dark outside. The color look good and it's overall rather easy to see. However, I did find the touch responsiveness to be inconsistent. Even after calibrating it, which did help, I still found myself having to touch the same on-screen buttons repeatedly.Sometimes it would even audibly acknowledge that I pressed something, then nothing would happen. In either case, this still requires a bit more pressure than your average garmin would, for example. Nothing major and it's still usable.AUDIOThe speaker is the loudest speaker I've ever heard from a device of this size. I can actually hear it perfectly fine over my stereo system at normal listening levels. And I can even understand what the nav lady is saying. I never had to go over  volume. So that should be quite handy in a noisy 18 wheeler.I was already planning on using that audio-out jack, but fortunately, it won't be needed.NAVIGATION & SOFTWAREThe navigation itself is on the average side of the things. The interface feels slightly dated in terms of graphics, detail, and responsiveness. After spending a few minutes using it, I was able to find my way around rather easily, if not quite as fast as I'd like. Although it does have a tutorial and FAQ that I do recommend if you're new to this product. It will explain how the interface works and some new features you may not be aware of.Choosing a destination, creating multiple point stops, and finding POI's were all straight forward and worked as I'd expect. Thanks to the large screen you do have plenty of information on the screen including speed, elevation, time, and whatever overlay you've selected. More on that later. The text & image showing your next turn and current street are easy to see.And yes, even after getting the latest update from Rand McNally, there are still limited street names. I'm talking so limited it's enough to cost it a star. It has a few major street names and of course tells you what street you are on as its related to your route. But that's about it.I can understand in some situations a trucker might not care about anything other than a major highway, but I would hope you could at least turn this feature on/off. After all, some large trucks do need to go venture off the major roads. Especially smaller trucks. This just limits the usefulness for no good reason.TRUCK MODE FEATURESWe can't forget about these new features added specifically for truckers. The navigation unit will either keep stats as an ""FYI"" or in most cases, use it to provide helpful information along your route. I should also note that this has a Car and Truck mode. So you can switch to car mode and disable the extra trucker-specific features you may not want. After all, many truck drivers do own normal vehicles. :)You can add info specific to your rig such as Hazmat type, weight loaded/empty, height, width, trailers, etc. That's pretty much it for the trucker-only features. The rest may be particularly helpful for truckers, but it's something your average driver may also be able to use.Those features include driving session, hours, 2 odometers, total week hours, maintenance intervals, and several other logs and fuel reports to keep track of how much fuel was used (and how much it cost). During your route there are warnings you can turn on/off, such as sharp curves & hills, how long you've driven, speed limit alert, state border alert, time zone change, weigh stations, toll booth alert, etc.Basically way more stuff than I'm going to use, but I do like having the options there that cover everything.EXTRA FEATURES (Wi-Fi)There are some extra features that take advantage of the WiFi functionality. Yes, it does have Wireless, but it's usefulness is somewhat limited in more ways than one. First you'll need to ""Enable WiFi"" via Preferences each time you turn the device on and select an Access Point. Then to use these features, tap the round sun/cloud icon in the bottom right corner.Once there you'll see that it has a basic weather forecast for the next 3 days. You can select various map overlay features including traffic, temperature, weather, chance of rain, type and intensity of precipitation with clouds, dew point, humidity, and local wind speed. Regardless of what you select, you will need a WiFi connection for it to work.So I turned on my phones hotspot feature. Well, some of these overlays are nice. Such as wind speed and temperature as they are displayed with a nice graph. The rest are somewhat less useful. Weather cloud cover is static (which in real life, it is not) and traffic never did seem to work right.There is optional add-on hardware for a over-the-air traffic updates that doesn't require Wi-Fi, but that should be standard, and much cheaper.PROS+ Large & Bright screen+ Lots of driving features+ Trucker specific options+ WiFi Options+ Loud speaker+ USB Updates (Not available over WiFi)CONS- Sluggish performance- Unresponsive touchscreen- Very limited street names displayed- No built-in MP3 player- No over-the-air traffic updates included- Short windshield mount- Rear MiniUSB PortCONCLUSIONThe issue I have is that my 3 year old garmin has better usability than this particular unit. Although this obviously has far more ""driving"" features and is not without it's pluses. If you're a truck driver who really could use all of these extra features, it won't be the best NAV out there, but it is worth considering. Although one might consider finding a separate device or app for trucking and buy a better ""non-trucking"" NAV unit.For anybody else, you're probably better off waiting until this device gets a little more polish. Improve the responsiveness of the screen, add an MP3 player so we can actually use the MicroSD card slot, and include over-the-air traffic updates. I'd also suggest taking advantage of this large device and swapping MicroSD for full-size SD. And I like what's trying to happen with WiFi, it just needs a lot more work.So it's not a bad device, but it's not great either. Unfortunately for this GPS, at this price point, there's just a lot of really good NAV units out there.",1,2,0.011456886,0.09654877,0.8919944
I've gone through about 300 of these over the last few years.These are good if you consider the fact that there WILL be some coasters (up to 20%). For better results try burning at 4x instead of max.

"I'm glad to see they removed the &#34;noise-canceling&#34; claim, because they lack any sort of active noise-canceling.These have decent sound quality and are full-featured for the price. I'd like to know how many people actually use the Micro SD capability, though.I have two main complaints. First is the noise-canceling. The company has removed that claim, but it was there when I purchased, and was a primary consideration for me. Second is the colored LED that is always on, even if you're using the corded capability. For some reason, when you use these with the included cord, they still need to be powered on. And that fact is advertised with a bright green glowing light. If you're using these in a darkened room, the light is very obnoxious. As it is when using in BT mode. The blue light in that case is likewise very distracting.Overall, these didn't really meet my requirements. I wanted something to drown out the noisy neighbors when I'm trying to sleep. Even after I covered the light with a sock, I didn't get the sound isolation I was looking for. I ended up getting a much simpler, wired headset (Howard Leight Sync Noise Blocking) that do an amazing job of blocking external sound.I'll make occasional use of these, but I wouldn't recommend them or buy them again.",1,2,0.005048199,0.090929255,0.9040226
"[EDIT 1/26/2013] Unfortunately I've experienced some issues with this router that are important enough I knocked two stars off In fact, it's currently bricked. Some important information I learned after the fact is that there are some odd recommendation for upgrading the firmware for this device. Normally - I wouldn't recommend updating the firmware, but a few items cropped up after purchasing this that were important enough to require a firmware upgrade attempt. One big reason I purchased this was to share media across my network. Unfortunately turning this into an iTunes media sharing device would send it crashing - a few other built in settings had the same result. Apparently I'm learning that firmware upgrades are recommended through Firefox (on Windows) and Safari on a Mac. You should always back up your settings, but I learned that D-link also recommends then resetting the device back to factory defaults before upgrading - this is a very odd request as the firmware upgrade process should reload factory defaults on its own. It seems to me that if standard browsers , and settings are enough to corrupt the firmware - it's an important enough issue that the firmware should come with a 'Read me' file containing those instructions - or the process should not be released as is. [End EDIT]When I ordered this product was back-ordered - with an estimated delivery of 2-5 days from the day I'm writing this. Amazingly - it arrived yesterday so I set it up yesterday as well. I also configured the software for the attached hard driveWestern Digital 1TB My Book Essential USB 2.0 External Hard Driveand it works great on my Mac and PC - iTunes immediately picked up on the media sharing as well.I have a few devices on my home network that wouldn't connect to my former router - those devices connected to this no problem and the router reports a 94% connection or higher.In short here's the rundown..The Good:Fairly compact size and shape (that kind of looks like a re-invented Dalek or Darth Vader's meditation chamber)Fairly easy walk through to set up initiallyFairly easy set up for the WirelessVery easy to update the firmware! (I suspect one of the cons would have been a non issue had I updated the firmware first)Connected to *all* of my WiFi devices (including two known for WiFi connectivity issues)The Bad:Manual setup didn't work the first time - requiring a walk through the setup wizard and back to manual to tweak a setting or two - hard to subtract anything more than 1/4 star as it was easily remedied (firmware issue?)Not wall mountable - so I'll need to get a shelf or make a hanger for it (I knew this going in, so no stars off)iTunes media sharing crashes the device, along with some other built in, though more advanced settingsupgrading firmware bricked the device.I'll continue to update this if I run into any issues, have any downtime/outages, as I attempt to connect more devices or customize the connections to specific devices on the network (port forwarding, etc.) Though I haven't done any 'real testing', a few video streams I watched did seem to buffer faster and have fewer glitches on my older Roku. The real tests will come when I start streaming on multiple devices and have the full network migrated over and running entirely from this device.",1,0,0.8988375,0.08487201,0.016290387

"The thought of waiting until Monday was just too much for me, so I picked this up at Best Buy (sorry!), but I actually got it a day early and have been playing/testing it all day.  I've been waiting for a Tegra 3 version of Sony's tablet for awhile, and I have to say it's everything I was waiting for, with one boneheaded play by Sony.First the good stuff:This tablet is FAST and responsive. There's no setting for power saving or performance. It does it automatically, scoring well over 11,000 in Antutu which places this tablet ahead of the Transformer Prime by a good 10%. It's not running Android 4.1 yet (Jellybean) but Sony has stated that they'll roll out a JB update in the near future. Let's hope they mean in one month instead of several.The display is GORGEOUS! And the non reflective surface is quite effective without sacrificing sharpness. Yes it's only 1280x800, but without content that supports the higher resolution Acer and Asus tablets, those extra pixels are being wasted, save for text. I purposely picked a standard resolution tablet. I don't think the higher resolution tablets are quite there yet. Anyway, the display is IPS, and can be turned up quite bright. Colors are vivid, and contrast is excellent. They did a great job with their display design.The sound is also excellent, with Sony's ClearFi technology making this one of the loudest tablets I've heard. You can even simulate Surround Sound for a more enhanced video playback. Sound reproduction is excellent, and the graphic equalizer with presets works very well.I like the infrared universal remote a lot. It works well and is easy to set up. You can even make macros now that turns on everything at once, like your TV and Blue Ray player and sound system with one button press. Quite nice!Sony's design is one of a kind. The ""folded"" magazine form factor really does make holding this tablet a joy. It's not just another slab of tablet. It's also thinner and lighter than its predecessor, and sports an aluminum back for a more solid feel.Now for the bad:The original review units that Sony displayed at trade shows featured a USB and HDMI port. They opted to instead remove these and install a proprietary Multiport (which is on the bottom and not the side as shown in the photos here on Amazon). This was a cold, calculated move on Sony's part to squeeze more money out of consumers by forcing them to spend at a minimum $50 for a USB host cable and HDMI cable. What makes it worse is that you can't use both at the same time. One port, one cable. I find this redesign infuriating, because otherwise this tablet would have been the closest to ""perfect"" that I've yet seen. It's a terrible shame that some suit at Sony pushed this idea through. One saving grace is the full sized SD card slot, which makes expanded memory quite affordable and easy, although it kind of ruins the need for a 32 and 64 GB model in my opinion. 16GB works fine for me with a cheap ultra SDHC SD card for 32 gigs of extra room.The other potentially bad news is that, despite what all the major review sites state, this is NOT a Playstation Certified device. I verified this with a call to Sony's tech support. As far as being compatible with Sony Mobile, which might have ps one games, the same tech stated that they aren't even sure that They'll ever release Sony Mobile. Sorry folks.Overall, I still really like this tablet, and it would have deserved five stars, were it not for that stupid multiport. Dumb, dumb, dumb move Sony.UPDATE: I wound up returning the tablet after discovering a couple of potentially killer issues:1. The WIFI issues continue. I got it to stop turning off when sleeping, but after a hard shutdown, it does not want to connect, even telling me that the router is out of range (even though it's 5 feet away). The only remedy is to disable/re-enable the WIFI. This is generally indicative of poor software and or hardware issues.2. It simply shuts off completely in the middle of activities. Don't ask me why. I have no idea, but for now I'm done with this tablet until they get the bugs worked out And make some improvements.",1,2,0.003105324,0.012741838,0.98415285

"Overall: the remote is good, but be aware - the listed range is excessively overstated for typical use...If you are familiar with Harmony remotes, setup is typical; otherwise, it is a bit tedious, but not overwhelming.  One issue is that Harmony cannot (or at least will not) port an existing remote configuration from a lower remote to the 900 - net, you'll have to rebuild your devices and activities from scratch!The remote works reliably and the blasters work as advertised with one glaring exception - the listed range of 100' is not supported in a typical house (has other wireless devices in the area).  Based on a lengthy call with Harmony Tech Support to resolve blaster issues, they recommend a range of only 20 - 25 feet if you have any other wireless devices in your house (wireless phone, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.).  This seems quite restrictive for such an expensive product.  If you only need a close in product - it works great.  If you need the range - be ready to return it...Personal experience is that at 35 feet, the RF becomes sketchy enough to seriously degrade the product's usefulness (to be clear, that's 35 feet in clear air as my blaster is in the open)...",1,2,0.006103033,0.13806157,0.8558354

Sorry I know the title is a little harsh but I will have to definitely say to stay away from the round sata cabling vs the flat cabling. The product works great nothing wrong with the effective data transfer of this cable but the cable is thick and extremely hard to maneuver in tight spaces. I build and rebuilt my personal gaming rig and I can attest that any round cabling is a extreme no no for any computer building. The only reason I gave this a 3 star instead of a 1 start is the fact that the cable worked well with its data transfer rates.

"Purchased this to replace an older HD docking station that died.  I was using the older one via SATA but decided to purchase a USB 3.0 card to install in my Mac Pro for this new docking station.I had to use SATA for the first 4 days of having it since I was waiting on a Y Molex power cable for the USB 3.0 card.

"I love this clothesline in principle.  I really wanted a clothesline on my 3-season porch, without criss-crossing the yard or having it permanently hanging on the porch.  This seemed like a perfect solution, is fairly unobtrusive in design, and was incredibly easy to install (I did it myself).  I would say an electric screwdriver is a must, though, unless you have a really strong arm with a screwdriver.The problem is the adjustable nature of it.  Unless your area is exactly the length of the clothesline length, it majorly sags and pulls further out of the container as you add clothes/towels etc to the line.  I bought this mostly for drying sweaters and other delicates and the line was sagging to the degree that the clothes were an inch from the floor, with only 3 lightweight sweaters on it.  I guess my porch is a little less than 20 feet long... If my porch were about 5-6 inches longer, the clothesline would be pulled out to its full extent and tension wouldnt be an issue, but as it is, those 6 inches sink straight to the ground.

"I picked this TV to replace an older Samsung LCD; my primary uses are games, sports, and the occasional movie. I used it for 2 weeks steadily.This TV was easy to set up - it found my Wi-Fi network quickly and offered a firmware update which installed without hassle. The remote is easy to use and the menus are responsive. The settings are, unfortunately, few, as it seems to lack advanced picture controls (white balance and the like). However, working with what I had, I used the Disney WOW Blu-Ray to calibrate. The end results turned out to be very similar to ""custom mode.""The picture quality was good. Colors are great and I found motion handling to be very good. I didn't notice any ""soap opera effect"" - motion looked good to me. The one issue is that the default black setting (""Dark"") crushed like crazy - no details could be found in dark scenes, and it was impossible to calibrate games (you know - ""move the cursor until you barely see the logo""). Changing it to ""light"" resolved the issue, though.I don't have much to say on sound quality - it seemed loud and clear, but lacking ""punch."" I use a cheap Sony sound bar, and the sound on the TV definitely wasn't even close to that. Thankfully, the TV has an optical out so setup was not a hassle. I plugged in my cable box, PS3, and 360 to the TV through HDMI and routed the optical cord to the sound bar.This is my first 3D TV so I was eager to try out the 3D. Panasonic thankfully includes four glasses, which were a good side and fit comfortably even over my regular glasses. I am not well-versed on the difference between passive and active sets but this looked good. Some games looked great (Killzone 3, Super Stardust), some looked muddy and undetailed (Gears 3, Resistance 3). The TV even has a weird 2D-to-3D mode which can turn regular content into 3D. I tried it with a basketball game and it wasn't bad, though I wouldn't use it that much.Game support was just fine. With game mode turned off, games were pretty choppy and tore a lot, but with game mode on, it was smooth and responsive. I don't have a way to accurately measure lag but it seemed very good to me - 1-2 frames at most. The games I played looked good and Street Fighter was responsive - no complaints at all there.So. Good gaming, good picture, good 3D. Everything's great, right? Unfortunately not. The big problem with my set was banding, which is basically issues with uniformity in the backlight. The light is not distributed evenly which causes vertical bands to show up. Make no mistake - this is noticeable in certain content, and it detracts from the experience. Soccer matches and games with bright vistas (think Crysis or something like that) look dingy. It's gross, and unfortunately a dealbreaker. The set was returned.I'm not happy about it, but this is an inevitability when margins are so tight and competition is so fierce. I mean, most people probably won't notice it, but I do. It's quite possibly that I just got a bad panel, but it's possible I didn't. In my research, this appears to be a common issue with all LEDs, from all manufacturers.

Administration features  - not great, thought he WRT had more and was easier to use.  Had issues with the ""Green"" part, as it would cut off my RDP sessions (like it saw that the session was not in use after a short period of time and shut it down).Overall, I returned this and purchased a Netgear Rangemax WNDR3700 Dual Band Wireless-N Gigabit Router.  Love the Netgear - far stronger signal, way more admin. features and easier to use.  I paid less as well.The TrendNEt LCD screen was strange, I just put it high up on a shelf in a closet - maybe some use the screen but I see it as a big waste.",1,1,0.3957656,0.5370005,0.06723396

The speaker isn't too terrible sounding but really does lack the bass that I thought it MIGHT be able to achieve. I was too disappointed in the low range of the Angle to convince myself to hang onto it and yes, paid double for the UE Mini Boom because it's one step up as far as wireless bluetooths go and the reviews said it had better bass, partially because of the redesign from its predecessor and the passive radiator in the back.",1,1,0.12330904,0.83193475,0.044756215
"The reviews here indicate that a few people are having ""lock up"" problems with the Xpress RC radio and now I'm one of them.The radio has been installed for two weeks now and it has locked up twice.  The display freezes and the buttons become useless.  Killing power to the unit causes it to reset and begin working again but it awakes having lost all its setup info.DELPHI tech support is going to replace it for me (shipping to them is at my expense) and I hope the replacement unit is better.During my conversation with them I learned that the Xpress RC is manufactured by both DELPHI and by AUDIOVOX.  The units look identical and you must read the fine print to determine which is which.I now see that Amazon sells the AUDIOVOX unit also, but it has no customer reviews.

"After reading reviews here and elsewhere, I took the plunge on this lens because I was looking for something a bit longer than Canon's 100mm-400mm lens (which is getting long in the tooth and overdue for a new version). I've been using a Canon consumer grade lens (18-200mm F3.5-5.6 IS) for over a year with outstanding results; I expected to get similar, if not slightly better image quality from the Sigma.  And I wasn't deluding myself that this would even approach ""L"" quality.But the build quality seemed excellent, and as others have noted, the lens is tank-like heavy.  Upon taking it out to a bird sanctuary, I took about 100 pictures at the 400-500mm range, some handheld, some on a monopod, and some on a tripod. (Yes, I turned OS off when on the 'pods.)  On most, there was a ton of chromatic aberration, and of course the Canon software won't correct for third party lenses in post, leaving Photoshop (sigh) as the best option for lens correction post-processing.  Besides the chromatic aberration being much worse than the aforementioned consumer Canon lens, the images were soft at the 400-500mm range. Of those 100, I got no more than ten that were keepers. That's a much lower percentage of keepers than I get with the Canon.So off it went back to Amazon.  I'm now deciding whether to go with the 100-400mm L, the 70-200 f2.8 IS II, or the 28-300mm L. I know I'm sticking to Canon glass from now on.",1,2,0.01396469,0.024872564,0.9611627
"I like the device very much, but it's lacking in a couple areas.First, the administrator cannot access folders using a separate folder-specific login. If you are the administrator, you cannot access folders to which security has been applied unless you remove the security. I wanted to create a folder for each member of my household, including myself, and use folder-level security to make each folder accessible to just that household member. Folder-level security works on computers other than the administrator's, but the administrator login overrides all other logins, so if you are administrator, you cannot use a separate login to access one or more folders on this device. When I attempt to log in to a folder to which security has been applied, I get an error message. There's another problem related to this problem but involving the backup software, which also uses a login.Second, the service has not been stellar. I only learned about the problem above by communicating with other users. When I called for phone support, I got shuffled around from group to group (it's not really a server, but it's not just a hard drive) and never really got an answer.I eventually gave up and accepted it for what it is, which is still pretty good.",1,1,0.3215844,0.5978085,0.08060707
"****TO THOSE WHO NOTICED THE UN LEVELED MONITORS*******I tilted them downwards and then rotated them to make them flush. It is not terribly noticeable unless you have them perfectly perpendicular.****THE REVIEW****I bought this because I needed more desk space. I have a full home theater center channel on my desk and I needed my monitors to lift above this center channel if I had any hope of using my table for anything productive. Even my mousepad wasnt fitting. I only had 60 bucks left, so this is what I went with. The only other option was to wait it out and blow 200 bucks on multiple adjustable arms and long power/DVi cables for my monitors. In retrospect, that is exactly what i should have done.The first flaw in this is that they dont tell you a single measurement anywhere about the product. It was already delivery day by the time this struck me, so I had to wait it out. Luckily, my 27&#34; Asus VE278Q monitors are able to clear my Pioneer C22 center channel. They also dont tell you how far forward this thing sticks. I didnt really save all that much desk space along the middle because the center channel actually moved forward quite a bit (like 3 inches on a 23&#34; desk).The other reviews are right. The left monitor is a full half an inch lower than the right monitor. no matter what you do, you will never get these flush. I understand manufacturing tolerances, but seriously, vivo? Made in china has its limits. Incase you didnt know, you are allowed to specify tolerances and theres a wonderful thing in the industry called &#34;quality control&#34;.The mounting mechanism is REALLY secure. So much so that I fear for the life of my ikea desk. Good riddance, if it breaks though. Screw this thing. But at least the monitors wont be going anywhere. Mounting them on the thing was a pain because of the spacers I had to use. It would be a lot easier with 2 people, or if the desk can be pulled away from the wall. But thats whatever. I managed to do it, and i'm pretty sick right now too.The tensioning screws are BS. The company insists you can tension them but they CANNOT hold these 27&#34; monitors. I was afraid i'd break either the monitor or the wrench or something while trying to tension things enough to hold the weight. my monitors are 20 pounds SHIPPED. So I'd never recommend this for more than 24&#34; monitors. There is PLENTY of wiggle room though for 27&#34; monitors. Its not like you will be cramped and unable to shift one without disturbing the other. Its just that the weight is not too great.The cheap plastic bullcrap thing they have on the back to hold the entire assembly from sliding up/down is another irritating point. I had to tighten the crap otu of that thing and it still has a tendency to slide down. use metal parts and sharp things where it matters, vivo. I get that this is a 60 dollar product but it cant possibly cost that much to make the pole rough instead of making it baby smooth with another baby smooth plastic washer to create friction. Also, if i ever loosen this thing, thats it. that plastic piece in there is probably disintegrated and cracked to oblivion. Theres no way this is more than a 1 time use product.overall, this thing got the job done in a pinch, but theres no way i'd consider it a good decision. I'll enjoy it while I can but im going to keep a really nice hold on my actual monitor stands and keep an eye on the market for some better stands. Maybe the rotating dell ones would fit or something.",1,2,0.0013822058,0.003273855,0.99534386

"Compared to the Hero 2 I have this camera has some advantages.First among them is battery life. This is a drastic improvement over my Hero2, even with the battery backpak. It is also a bit smaller and lighter. The lens is a bit of an improvement in areas like near object sharpness. The new video modes for HD don't really impress me as the frame rate drops to get them. I find the color to be superior to the Hero2, it's quite a bit more vivid, without looking fake.  It's also far superior to the Hero2 in low-light shooting. WiFi is an &#34;upgrade&#34; of sorts from the Hero2. It isn't a simple setup and it drains the battery quickly and doesn't have a very long range. The close stills are as good as my HTC phone, not as good as my iPhone 5.  Sound capture was very good, I found it clearer than the Hero2.The major con for me is that objects about 8-10 feet away are blurred. I find this unacceptable for action video as the background is as important to me as the foreground. The still shots suffer from this as would be expected.The camera is constructed every bit as solid as the Hero2. I would still expect to use bacpak batteries for longer shoots.Also, all my shooting was done on fast, high quality class 10 SD cards.  Don't cheap out here or you will definitely be unsatisfied with the video!Overall, it's a decent camera for the price, the blurring of slighlty distant objects may not bother others as it does me, so I can't not recommend it based on that.

"My interest in this drive was backing up my notebook computer and to have full file compatibility with MAC users by using this USB HFS+ drive with a Windows XP computer.  Unfortunately, I experienced a multitude of problems that thwarted that objective.The process of downloading and installing the Paragon HFS+ Windows file system driver from Seagate's Website locked up my computer and then gave me the dreaded blue screen.  Being an experienced computer-user, I was finally able to restart my computer and try again with the HFS+ driver installation.  This time I was able to install the driver without locking up my computer, but every time I plugged in the Seagate USB drive, it would cause my computer to repeatedly reboot.Finally, I un-installed the troublesome HFS+ driver and used Windows System Restore to get my computer back to normal operation.  That stopped this drive from crashing my computer every time I plugged it in.  Using Acronis True Image Home, I was able to successfully reformat this drive using NTFS.  This erased the utility programs that were on the drive, and of course eliminated any compatibility with the MAC HFS+ disk system, but it enabled me to access the drive via Windows and assign a drive letter to it.Since my interest in this drive was mostly for backup, I did a copy and paste of 59,695 files and 2,259 folders totaling 140GB from my computer's internal drive to this reformatted Seagate USB drive.  The entire copy process took 9 hours and 58 minutes.  This is slower than the time it takes for me to copy about the same amount of data from my notebook computer to a NAS drive on my wired network.  Therefore the speed of this USB 2.0 drive is nothing to write home about.Conclusion:  Although I did not test this drive with a MAC it should work just fine with one and perhaps even a Windows 7 computer, but I cannot recommend it for a Windows XP computer.  Seagate makes a Windows version of this drive with a faster USB 3.0 interface for the same price that would be a better choice.Aside from the technical and compatibility issues, this drive comes in an elegant package, is compact, attractive and weighs just 5.5 ounces with the USB connecting cable.  The end of the drive is removable to allow for a direct SATA connection if desired.

They're only slightly less detailed than the the HD quality disks on my 32"" set with a really nice natural contrast.  Images from my old DVD player aren't even close.But I'm left with a couple of concerns.....First, it seems odd that I should get a 'system error' message with the '300' HD DVD included right in the box.  It doesn't give me a whole lot of confidence for future purchases.  And I went through the whole process of creating a CD to update the firmware to no avail - not a job for the technologically challenged I might add.Second, I bought a Toshiba HD TV at the same time.  Gee, wouldn't you think the TV remote should work with the player right out of the box?  No, and my subsequent efforts to try the other codes haven't fixed the problem either.Third, I'm a bit anxious about its handling of dirty/damaged DVD's of any variety - it seems prone to lock up rather than fight its way through the bad spots.Maybe these are just some initial rough spots and the future will be rosier, I just can't tell yet.

"These speakers perform decent for movies but poor with music. I direct this to the enthusiast, not to the casual listener.For music listening they have a muddied high end and a boomy and occasionally distorted low end. Their sound stage is very forward which disappoints when you're listening to a good live recording of music. If you want a speaker that can perform on all ends of the spectrum, save your money and look at purchasing the HSU Research HB-1 MK2. This is also a horn loaded speaker (a bookshelf, not a tower) priced around the same but will perform much better with music and imo better with movies as well.I don't hate these speakers but they're overpriced for how they perform.

"UPDATE 4/21/2013First, two stars off for build quality.  I'm not talking about the plastic filter threads others complain about, which really is very disappointing to find on a lens costing more than $50.  I'm complaining about the basic build robustness and Nikon's poor quality control that led be to return four copies to Amazon because each had two or more of these defects:__ Extreme amount of lateral chromatic aberration.  Wide open, this lens on a Nikon D800 should have at most two pixels purple fringing in high contrast areas.  Samples returned were so bad, test targets had an overall purple cast.__ Fuzzy images.  This is related to LCA and likely alignment problems.__ Manual focus had a gritty or crunchy feel, unlike any lens I've every handled.  Other reviewers report slipping, but I did not have that problem.__ Auto Focus sticks is several places. I can't hear the motor engage.__ The Nikon gold lettering was flaking off, right out of the box.  I've never seen that before!After returning four copies to Amazon, I thought maybe they just got a bad production run.  So I ordered a fifth lens from Adorama and it has made it through the checklist above and appears to be in spec.PotentialI shoot with a Nikon D800, which is very demanding on the optics.  DxO labs scores the 28mm f/1.8G a 33, making the best performing 28mm lens available in a Nikon mount at any price.  It is even somewhat sharper than the legendary Nikon 24mm f/1.4 at a fraction of the price.PracticalOperating the lens, AF is fast and responsive when it works.  If you're shooting video, though, the ""Silent"" Wave motor is pretty loud, so it will be picked up on the audio track if you use the built-in or an attached microphone.  Unfortunately, the manual focus for my final sample is still a little gritty and audible, so you can't pull focus on a sound scene with an attached mic.  The lens is light weight and has a relatively small front element for it's speed.  It is physically long, with a higher profile than the 50mm f/1.4 G.Image Quality- Vignette is very strong and pronounced at f1.8, completely gone by f4.0.- Lateral Chromatic Aberration is about 10m at f1.8 and well corrected by f2.8- Distortion is remarkably low on an FX sensor for a lens this wide and fast.- Images have good contrast and saturation.I'm on the fence about recommending this lens.

"*edited* removed one star because the exact same case for the ipad is $55. Twenty dollars more for a case that isn't even specifically made for my tablet (inaccurate holes in screen protector) ... I'm disappointed in Otterbox.OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for iPad 4th Generation, iPad 2 and 3 - BlackI debated for a few days before buying this case. I was worried about the spen working well through the screen protector. This is not an issue but there are some things you should be aware of.Positives: With the cover on I feel like I could through my tablet against a wall, run it over with my car and let my dog chew on it and it would be fine.The screen protector is crystal clear and with the exception of causing a minor increase in friction works very well with the spen.It fits snugly like all otter boxesNegatives: the spen is moderately harder to get out when the cover is removed and attached to the back of the case, but I have large hands (XL gloves are snug) so this may be less of a problem for others.Initial install is difficult. It's hard to open and the directions aren't clear. I had to use a buyer knife to pry the outer rubber from the inner hard plastic. I don't want anticipate removing this case very often but it will be just as difficult when necessary.As other reviewers have mentioned there is a weird cut out in the screen protector that sort of (in a not flattering way) goes around the samsung logo at the top of the screen. Apparently this is for other models that have a speaker there but it's very clearly out of place on the U.S. version. I expect more for the priceThe stand does not work as the directions say. It does hold it in the 4 positions that they claim but not if you place the tablet where the directions say to. I'll upload some pictures to make this more clear. Again, not a huge deal, but for the price and with the otter box name I've come to expect perfection.It's very heavy, I take it off if I have to hold it for long periods... i.e. When reading a book.Overall I would buy it again but I would like to see the quality I expect from otter box that generally warrents the high price. If they fixed the problems above or lowered the price to around $45 I would give it 5 stars.",1,2,0.15559377,0.36759752,0.4768087
"This model has a capacity boundary of 3TB listed on the unit itself, while this wasn't mentioned in the specs on the sales page. I did read some reviews that people tested 4TB drives and they worked, but it is certainly safer to buy a docking bay rated for greater capacity drives. Had I known it, I would have opted for a different product, like thePlugable USB 3.0/2.0 SATA Hard Drive Docking Station (ASMedia Chipset; UASP and 3TB+ Support)which is $10 cheaper here at Amazon that this Uspeed, though the other lacks the optional eSATA output. That unit also supports UASP, the newer protocol for USB 3.0 which makes 3.0 even faster. (W7 does not as yet support UASP, but will eventually.)I also learned these units (none of them) are meant for reading bootable drives, which is a Windows shortcoming. They are intended to use with data drives.I was using an Acer laptop with the bay and plugged in a bootable drive removed from the laptop when I upgraded recently. The drive showed up everywhere but My Computer. In Device Mgr, and in Admin Tools / Storage. It was there I noticed the drive and its many partitions were not assigned any drive letters, and it was noted as being ""offline."" A mouse-over revealed a msg that Windows could not determine why the drive was offline. There was no option to put it online.I then tried the Uspeed bay with my other laptop (Toshiba) and got the same result, but this time when I checked Admin Tools / Storage and moused over the word ""offline"" I got a message that the drive was offline due to a signature collision. This occurs when Windows can't tell two bootable hard drives apart, so it keeps the external one offline. However, this time when I right-clicked on the word ""offline"" I was able to get a popup with ""Online"" as a choice. I chose that and Windows quickly assigned all the partitions letters *except* the ""C"" partition, which it skipped over and kept offline.Now unhappily for me, the whole reason I bought this docking bay was to pull data off old drives that used to be installed in my computers, of which every one is a bootable drive. But this might only happen when the drives are the same manufacturer and also partitioned the same (as mine were), and are also the same footprint (both 2.5 or both 3.5 drives). Because the unit DID read a bootable 3.5"" drive, though I wasn't paying enough attention to know for sure if it assigned the ""C"" drive a new letter or skipped over it. (If it doesn't assign it a drive letter you can't access that partition, making it useless.)IAC if you plug in a bootable drive and the bay doesn't see it, you might have a signature collision. Drive capacity does NOT have to match. (I had a collision with an internal 1.5TB, and an external 320GB, both 2.5"".)The bootable problem aside since that is not a shortcoming of the Uspeed bay, I would get the other unit anyway because of it having no capacity limit and UASP support. I already own a 3TB external BU drive and in 2 years I'll probably have something this bay won't read at all, plus I will want the extra speed of UASP by then too. The other bay, on the other hand, should be good to go for at least 5 yrs.",1,2,0.056426186,0.28747708,0.6560967

"The N100 cooling pad has a good design and overall feel. It has pretty good thermal qualities and should keep your lap cool even with the fan off. However, there is a design flaw in that there are only two small rubber pads providing any sort of traction to keep your laptop in place. When this is combined with the slight angle that the laptop sits it's a recipe for annoyance and perhaps disaster.Here's the details.First the positive:Construction. It's plastic, but it is sturdy and doesn't feel cheap. It has a tactile matte finish that doesn't stick to your skin. The soft curvature of the top and the bottom, as well as the overall wedge shape, make this comfortable and somewhat ergonomic.Cooling. I'm going to diverge from some of the negative reviews on this. This device is designed more to keep you cool than to cool your laptop. Your laptop has fans for that and it needs to operate in a specific temperature range. If your laptop is overheating when on a flat, solid surface then you shouldn't buy this device thinking it will fix it. The fan and airflow design should keep the heat away from you and may reduce the temperature of your laptop. I can't hear this fan when it runs. With that in mind, I think this does a great job.Now the negative:The top of this pad is hard plastic with a little bit of texture to it. It is also curved for ergonomics and to increase airflow beneath the laptop. There are two rubber pads in the back to supposedly provide some friction and keep your laptop in place. However, my 3 year old MacBook white would not stay put on these pads. This meant that every time I moved in the slightest my laptop would slide off of this thing. I could not put it on the edge of a table, either because it would sometimes slide off after being set down.Obviously, if your laptop has better traction than mine then this won't happen to you. If it does, there are two work-arounds I can suggest. The first is to buy one of the other models that features stoppers in the front. If Logitech had included these on this model I'd likely be giving it 5 stars. The second is to do what I did and buy some sort of non-slip mat to put on the front portion of the pad. Make sure that whatever grippy stuff you get can handle the temperatures under that part of your laptop, but when you combine a little extra grip up front with the small pads in the back this becomes a great product.",1,1,0.038339127,0.52661556,0.43504527

"I bought the 65ST60 in Sep of 2013.  I had a Panny 50PZ80U for 6 years before this.  I did proper break in of 200hrs, zoomed in with the contrast at about 50.  After that point I used the picture settings from avsforum.com, which puts the contrast at 90 and brightness at +1.  Well over the next few months, I watched TV, a lot of ESPN, played PS3 games like COD with HUDs.In January '14, I started to notice the ESPN logo and then I started noticing everything.  HUDs and numbers from games.  So I tried to run the screen wipe. Didn't really work well.  I bought the Disney WOW blu-ray for the pixel flipper.  That works decent but still the logos and images never completely go away. Now I am always watchin ESPN zoomed all the way in so there is no logo!Now I am just disappointed.

Also, I needed to program it for the screen to shut down completely at night because, even in night mode, it is way too bright for a bedroom.  Lastly, it is frustratingly unresponsive when navigating menus.Even with those issues, I'm not upset that I spent $70 on it.  It performs a function that I wanted at a fairly reasonable price.

"ORIGINAL REVIEWThis Meike branded battery grip is well packaged and supplied with:- an AA battery magazine which takes 4 batteries; and- instructions.The grip seems to be well made and is a good fit for the D7000. It is secure - the wheel which tightens the unit to the camera protrudes from both the front and the rear of the grip so it's easy to both tighten and untighten. It is comfortable to use and stays firmly attached to the camera.  The grip seems to be identical to the Nikon MB D11 except that the operation of the main and sub command dials have been reversed.The instructions are virtually identical to those that come with the MB D11 except that ""MB D11"" has been changed to ""D7000."" It is also in fewer languages.I was initially attracted to buy this because I've had previous good experiences with a copy battery grip on my D80.At such a saving on the genuine article this is definitely worth 5 stars and is well recommended.UPDATEHaving just bought a second D7000 I wanted another battery grip to use with it. So far, I've bought and returned three grips as none of them worked properly. They all had the same fault in that they did not make a good electrical connection to the camera. When I connected the grips the display on the top of the camera cut out.I also tried each of the new grips with my old camera and experienced the same problem. I also tried my old grip with my new camera and experienced no problems. Each of the new grips must, therefore, have been defective.I'm now considering buying a genuine Nikon grip",1,2,0.0063190437,0.03882974,0.95485127

"I have been using this for two days now and am still debating returning this item. Here is my list of pros and cons:ProsNice keyboard layout, except the apostrophe. I had to search for it since it's not in the usual place. Not a big deal, but it is weirdThe ability to use the keyboard with other devices is nice. I haven't had to use it yet, but it is a nice feature.The keyboard is small, but the learning curve is pretty short. I have larger hands and it hasn't taken too long to be comfortable with the keysI feel like my kindle is protected a bit better now, compared to the thin case I had been usingThe small rest area at the bottom of the keyboard is surprisingly helpful. I didn't think it would make a difference, but it doesEven with the keyboard attached, it is not too difficult to use my kindle in portrait mode. I just set the keyboard aside and it was fineThe keys have a nice feel and response.  It is much better than the onscreen keyboardThe kickstand is strong and the angle is just right for reading, typing and videosThe cutouts are in the right places and I had no problem charging the keyboardThe holder for the kindle is easy to use. It is very secure and the screen is not blocked at allPairing with my kindle was easy and quickI didn't notice and chemical odor when I opened the package, which was niceConsThe feel of the imitation leather is pretty cheap. I guess it is to be expected with the price, but I have purchased other imitation leather items and they didn't seem as cheap as this oneThe color is a bit darker than I was expecting. The picture looks more blue than black but I think mine is definitely darker. You can tell it is not black, but it's closeThe kickstand is strong, but it is very difficult to fold back into place. There is a piece of hard plastic inside - to support the stand- and I have to fold it down first, before closing the stand. I think I might just trim about 1\2 inch or so from the top of the piece. I don't think it will cause a problemThe stitching is not very strong on the ribbon strip attached to the kickstand. A couple of stitches are coming loose. I think it is probably from having to wrestle with it to close it.The charging port is on the right side of the keyboard - the charger for the kindle is on the left when it is in the case- so I turn the keyboard around when charging. I don't like cords all over place. Not a deal breaker, but it would have made more sense to me to put it on the left sideThe flap closure is not very easy to use. The strip of vinyl that the flap goes into seems like it will stretch out of shape quickly. A magnet or snap would have been so much better. I am going to put in a magnet closure, if I decide to keep this.Overall, I would give the keyboard 4 stars and the case 2 stars, so I averaged it out to 3.  I was looking at the Belkin case, but the price for that one is more than twice this one.  I think with a bit of do it yourself modifications, I may be happier with this one.",1,1,0.17320968,0.7041946,0.122595705
"It's inexpensive and the materials of the cover is little thin and flimsy.  As seen on the photos I've uploaded, the edges around the corners of the case doesn't fit as neatly but it does offer adequate protection.  I feel safe carrying my Kindle with this case cover on.  When the cover is folded as a base, it sit little too low and not very stable and becomes top-heavy.-Update July 16, 2014-one corner of the case cracked open from a moderate drop. The case didn't absorb all the impact and left a feint scratch on my Kindle.  I've applied a crazy glue to put back the piece that broke off.

"[Update: I'm resubmitting this review and replacing my previous 5-star with a 3-star rating. After keeping the drive on my key chain and using it successfully for just over a month, I came upon a USB port that was somewhat tight, offering more than the usual resistance. The USB connector on the Transcend really let me down by meekly retreating back inside its shell.  Only by grasping the flimsy slide lever hard was I successful with the insertion. Later I observed that even moderate finger pressure applied to the tip of the connector would cause it to retract when it was supposedly in ""locked"" position.  The Kingston 110 may be slow (see below), but it's no wimp: once extended, it holds its ground. The Transcend is fine for some applications, but it's not the rugged, all-purpose drive I had hoped for. It gets demoted to a drawer.]Having lost, misplaced, and apparently broken several of these midgets, I'm not sure that the manufacturers are doing consumers all that much of a favor by coming out with 16GB models no bigger or heavier than a half stick of chewing gum (would that they would stick to the owner!).  Here's my unscientific comparison (using a Macbook) of 4 available flash drives, all 4 with capless, retractable USB connectors and capable of being slipped on a key ring (my two requirements):1. Kingston Data Traveler 110.  Percentage of advertised storage space that's actually usable=96%.  Time required to transfer a 15 mb folder=29 seconds.  [Note: Kingston makes several other Data Traveler models, which may be faster than the 110.]2. Transcend JetFlash V10.  Percentage of advertised storage space that's usable=96%.  Time required to transfer 15 mb folder= 9 seconds.3. Last year's Sandisk Titanium Cruzer.  Percentage of usable storage space=93%.  Time to transfer 15mb folder=8 seconds.4. New Sandisk Titanium Cruzer (4 gigs). Usable storage space=95%. Time to transfer 15mb folder=5 seconds.Other considerations: The Sandisks are the most brightly lit and rugged in appearance but took slightly longer to appear on my desktop, the older one flickering before making contact.  Once connected, they perform well with a Macintosh, despite their reputation as Windows-only drives.  The slow Kingston 110 is the stubbiest of the 4, shorter but slightly wider (potentially problematic in some closely spaced ports) than the other three.  It's the only one that doesn't illuminate upon connection, but once attached to a key ring (through a hole in a thick part of the drive), it appears to be there to stay. The Transcend, like the Kingston, mounts instantly on a Mac desktop.  It comes with a driver installation CD for PC-Windows users, which in turn launches a program (JetFlash) compatible with Vista, and it offers the owner a lanyard necklace (almost disproportionate to the minuscule dimensions and weight of the drive but insurance against loss).Conclusions: The Transcend looks like a good, affordable bet in a nice color, though the Sandisks' metallic look and weighty feel are reassuringly professional.  And if any of the aforementioned 3 go AWOL, you can probably rely on the Kingston 110 to remain firmly attached to your key ring.[Later: I located a lost Kingston DT1, and its speed is comparable to the newest Sandisk Cruzer as well as this Transcend.  As for the Kingston Data Traveler 110, I retested it: it's still by far the slowest drive I've used in the past several years.]",1,2,0.08078533,0.09191768,0.82729703

The the basic setup requires that you input all of the components you will be using and whether you would like them on or off for certain functions (i.e. Watch TV = TV:ON, Receiver:ON, Cable Box:ON, DVD:OFF Volume Control:Receiver).My complaint is when you get to some of the more in depth controls the software seems to be lacking in the flexibility department.  I would like to program a couple of favorite channels for the soft keys on the screen, but I can't seem to get it to work.  Also, I would like to change some of the buttons around for the ""Listen to Music"" task. Although this flexibility is supposed to be there it is difficult to set up.I am by no means afraid of technology, and usually have no problems with gadgets like this.  But this one is difficult once you get beyond the very basic functions.  I hope to be able to fine tune the remote more.  I will update if I can unlock more potential in the unit...UPDATE...After 2 years of service, the Harmony 670 is starting to show its age.  There have been loose parts rattling around in the case since about 6 mos after I started using it.  It has continued to function, however the range has diminished a bit.  Recently the directional buttons in the center for menu navigation have started to become temperamental.  They will work, but not for fast scrolling, which can get a bit frustrating.  Battery life has actually been very good (3 sets of batteries in 2 years of moderate use).Overall a decent unit, and it's still kicking after 2 years in a house with small children, but it's time to start the search for a new universal remote.  I like the 670, but it's never been quite perfect. For the price it should have a little more functionality.  Like I said, soft keys for favorite channels would be a great software addition.  I think I may try a different Harmony Model.",1,2,0.055270188,0.3900311,0.5546987
"First pro/semi pro tripod I ever got.I am 6'4"" and fully extended the height of this is close to perfect for me.instructions light, but you can figure it all out.carry bag nice, but missing any interior pocket....This is a bummer since it came with a cool mini black bag with three wiping clothes in it. Also an extra quick release bar. The bar fits in the bag for a perfect accessory bag.Unfortunately, there is no place in the carry bag for this little item. You need to carry it somewhere else, which defeats the purpose of having a bag for the whole unit. I instead clipped it to a plastic tab in the bag itself.This carry bag needs a pocket for accessories.Not sure how good the pan/tilt thing is, as referenced by other reviewers...but for a hobbyist, its pretty good.there is also somekind of plastic clip in the middle of one arm. The clip has a pull out small rope that recedes when you release it. I imagine this is for stability? Not mentioned in description or manual...odd.all in all, guess I am stuck with this and hope it performs well.If my recordings suck, I will blame the tripod and not my poor video skills...LOLEDIT: Lowered it from 4 to 3 stars. When breaking it down the stickers on the knobs that say release/tighten came off in my hands..with just the first use. Most fell off and the rest are going to fall off...lame.the pan/tilt screw is not covered in the manual, but if you pull it out and reposition it, you can actually tighten it so it holds weight.in the middle of the unit, the three armed middle unit that stretches has a hole/knob on it, is this for extra weight to make it sturdy? No mention in manual?Overall seems like it will be useful, but tags falling off on first use is alarming...what is going to happen when I really use it to film?",1,1,0.3377076,0.60453767,0.057754755

"I guess I ordered the wrong size... My hard drive says it fits 9.5mm, so I ordered that size caddy. I didnt realize though, that you need to order based on the bay the caddy slides into, not the hard drive that goes inside the caddy... And my laptop has a 12.7mm optical bay. This caddy still fits, though it took a little coercing to line up the pins inside. Also, once inside, the retaining screw doesn't reach, so there's nothing holding it in but friction. I also had to shim the extra gap with a rubber band so it doesn't wiggle.HOWEVER....Even if it had fit the bay right, the holes on the front don't line up with the faceplate! I thought maybe that was just an issue of 9.5mm drives vs 12.7mm... But, I looked around at other 9.5mm caddys on amazon and this things holes are different from all those too! Look closely at the hole on the far left side (not the skinny side). That left hole is too far from the edge of the drive, every other drive (and faceplate) uses a hole much closer.I ordered a new caddy thats the right size, and has holes properly matched. Until then, this works it just looks funny with no faceplate. I also won't be moving it around much for now, since there's no retaining screw holding it in.",1,2,0.014507643,0.1364057,0.8490867

"It's low cost, decent quality, short enough and stays put at 70mph. The only problem I have with it is the cable length: it's about 3'-5' feet too short for full size truck owners, assuming you want to place it in the center of your cab roof in order to get the best ground plane.. In order to get the cable end to the bottom of the dash on my '04 F150 SuperCab, routing it through one of the vents on the back of the cab, I can only place the antenna at the very rear of my cab roof, at the center. In order to do that, the cable has to go strait down, so I can see it in the rear window of the cab.I want to place this at the center of my cab's roof, route the cable strait back using sticky mounts/zip ties, then along the upper edge of the back window, then down the side of the rear cab (so I don't have a view of the cable), I would need at least an extra 5 feet of cable to do that... add two more feet for most full size truck owners, since they are running full size cabs with four real doors.So, to make this work (properly) for a full size truck, you'll need to buy an RG58 or RG8X UHF cable, with PL-259 to SO-239 connectors... Here on Amazon, those are $10 and $4 shipping....ouch. If you are going to spend an extra $14 for a mag mount antenna for your truck, you might as well just buy either a Browning, MFJ or Comet solution, all of which have heavier and larger magnet bases, and options for separate/better antennas, if you need/want them. That is what I will be doing as soon as I can pawn this off on my girlfriend to use in her Jeep Liberty, which should fit just fine!I hope this helps my fellow full size truck owners!",1,2,0.006365144,0.14000349,0.8536314

"Hello,I purchased these speakers at amazon.com for a knockdown holiday sale price of $29.99 (Oct. 2004), they came in today and I tried them with some basic techno, metal and rock music. The sound quality is good. Also, the set up was a breeze, just plugged in the basic items to each other, and the best part was that the power cord doesnt have a large bulky adapter which would have hogged space at the power outlet.I also wish the speakers (not the woofer) could be of a bit higher wattage. The RMS (Root mean square) power is indeed below average. But note that RMS power is not the only consideration when purchasing the speakers, quality factor (Q) ratings and fidelity are very much more important than any thing else. A good example would be those tiny Bose speakers which deliver absolutely divine and crisp music.Addendum: I recently got a HUGE Home theatre system 800Watts - Sony. After listening to that... this speaker system sounds like an orphan crying in the scottish moors. Distant and not very pronounced.Look, if you are not crazy about too much sound... then this unit is good (when priced below $35.00).Otherwise go for a higher wattage system. and also go 5.1  surround sound systems.... you will enjoy the difference every single day.",1,2,0.020382684,0.11530532,0.86431205

"I bought this SUS-AGN1 after returning a somewhat similar device, the TP-LINK MR3040 ([...]  I liked the TP-LINK, but it didn't support many modems (only 11 in the US), and OpenWRT/DD-WRT seemed inadequate.The Peplink model was 2.5x the price and wasn't battery/USB powered, but it seemed like it had a real company behind it, and I needed something robust.  I spoke with Peplink sales and they seemed pretty great.  They said this ""on the go"" model should benefit from updates that their other Surf routers receive (i.e. new modems), though I'm a bit skeptical because the ""on the go"" product isn't even listed on their website anymore.  They also told me they can remotely connect to your router to try to make an unsupported modem work, if you invite them in.  This benefits them because they can add another modem to their list of supported devices.I eventually bought it from 3gstore (you can do that through amazon or directly) for an extra $5 because of their great support, and because another seller couldn't guarantee me the 2.0 hardware (which has a faster USB port to handle 4G modems).Overall the device works, but for the extra cost I was hoping for a slightly smoother experience.  I am a technical guy, and I've used cellular routers before, but it still took me about 2.5 hours of playing with this thing to really understand all the settings.  There are several items missing from the documentation that I needed to figure out or still haven't (profiles, bridge mode, ""preferred modem"").--A few things to note that may not be obvious:- Although this router supports both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz wifi, you can only use one at a time.  This is not how my dual band home router works.  Additionally, if using Wifi-as-WAN, then your local network must be on the same band (and channel) as the WAN network.- The failover feature is nice, but could be nicer.  Specifically, you can only failover to a USB modem.  I can imagine several scenarios where you may want to failover between Wired and Wifi, Wifi to Wifi, or even USB to Wired/Wifi.  As just one example, if your 3G device is a mobile hotspot, then you'd need Wired->Wifi failover to make use of it.  It would be great to see that added.  Also, your main link has to be down for 25 seconds minimum before failover is initiated.- Maybe it's limited just to my aircard (Franklin U301), but I couldn't get much info about the current state of the connection.  Was it 3G or 4G, what was the signal strength, etc.  Aside from ""Authenticating"" and ""Connected"", I couldn't see much status.- The Management interface seems ALWAYS accessible from the WAN side.  Can't disable WAN admin like other routers.  So make sure you set a strong password, or you're open for attack.- The Wifi-WAN profiles are confusing until you realize they are are similar to on a laptop:  You can add multiple wifi-WAN profiles, and the router will automatically pick the strongest one it sees.  (If you star a profile, it will take precedence.)  I think the Roaming mode will have the router periodically scan all of your profiles for stronger options.  There are 2 reasons this is confusing:1. When you ""select"" a profile in the settings, you aren't telling the router to use that profile.  You're just opening the profile to view/edit the options.2. If you search for a new wifi network and connect to it without first adding a new profile, then you are constantly just overwriting the settings for one of your existing profiles.  You could very easily accidentally overwrite a profile this way.- The power connector seems to use a standard 5.5mm x 2.1mm coaxial connector and provides 12VDC, so you should be able to power this thing from a simple car adapter like this one:  [...] - your car might have higher/lower voltages, and you could damage the thing, but in general it's likely to work fine.- The unit comes with suction cups so you can hang it from a window to give the antenna a good view.",1,1,0.106065944,0.46119422,0.4327398
"I have always used a PS3 as a bluray player and also for Netflix and Hulu Plus.My original PS3 60GB died recently and I decided to give a BluRay player a chance for online streaming.

"I wanted to give this product 5 stars because even though there are a couple of respectable drawbacks I still use them a lot. 3.5 stars would be more accurate, I think...I listen to a lot of music and I listen to it most of the day while at work.  My tastes are mixed.  Everything from Motzart to Steve Roach (ambient) to Rush (progressive rock) to pop (tons of 80's 90's).  I wanted wireless music from my DroidX2 phone which is what I use.The Good:  The electronics work well.  Pretty darn good sound quality but I have a pair of $10 ear buds that have a better bass sound than these.  Even so, the sound quality is easily acceptable unless you are really into hearing the slightest instrumental nuances in your music.  I'm very happy with the sound.The ability to use this product for a phone headset is fantastic.  I mean it's really good.  Incoming voice is very clear and I have yet to hear a complaint about my transmitions.  I really like that the caller's voice is in both of my ears.  Absolutely no compaints as it does exactly what it is supposed to do.Works great with my laptop after using a Medialink - USB Bluetooth Adapter which fits right into my laptop's USB port.The bad:  The erganomics of these headphones are not as good as they should be.  It will hurt my head after while.  I can only assume that a smaller head would have less trouble.  I wear a 7 1/2 hat size which puts me at a med/small and I will get sore ears and/or a headache after wearing these for an hour or more.Having said that, it isn't so uncomfortable that I have to take them off until I've been at it for 3 or 4 hours.  I listen to them at work so that amount of time isn't always enough.  Of course ideally they wouldn't give me a headache at all.  ;-)The controls aren't so easy to use.  The raised + / - signs that indicate the up and down volumn buttons aren't very helpful.  I have just gotten used to 'knowing' where to press for volumn control.  The Skip Forward and Backward in playlist bottons don't seem to work with PowerAMP which is a very popular app I use on my Droid.Finally, the plastic loop that runs behind your neck and connects the two speakers WILL WARP IF LEFT IN THE SUN AND WILL NOT BEND BACK.  I left mine in the car for about an hour and the loop is now a bit more curved on one side than it should be making the headphones a tad less comfortable to wear.  I should have known but just didn't think about it.In conclusion I would recommend these headphones because they do what is advertised and aren't too uncomfortable to wear for my head size so long as it's not for more than 3 hours or so at a time.

"My house (about 2400 sq ft) has places these two could not work between.

And before you suspect me of having a patchy home network, the Squeezebox is about 25 feet from my Airport Extreme base station and in its direct line of sight--no walls, furniture, pets, ghosts, or anything in the way. And, get this, my older and less expensiveAluratek AIRMM01runs flawlessly, well-hidden in the corner of a remote room far away from the Airport. I mostly listen to local HD radio and several internet stations (eg, Radio Paradise). I haven't tried the server software, so I can't speak to that. I have used several of  the Apps (Pandora, Last.fm) and they work fine, as I say, when they work.",1,2,0.01888859,0.09166374,0.8894477

"I bought from Amazon a SONY BRAVIA XBR55HX929 55-Inch 1080p 3D Local-Dimming LED HDTV with Built-In Wi-Fi, Black. Indeed, this is one fantastic HDTV. (See my review.)However, the speakers are just OK; they are not powerful. So, we added (from Amazon) a  SONY HTCT550W 3D Soundbar Home Theater System with Wireless Subwoofer and mounted the Soundbar component with a Soundbar Brackets Universal Soundbar Bracket (from Amazon). Although only 3 inches high, we mounted the SONY Soundbar on the top of the TV (TV on its stand on a table) because the Soundbar  blocked all of the remote control features on the bottom of the TV. In the end, though, the SONY Soundbar on this Bracket is worth the money. There are a few provisos, however.At first we just put both the Soundbar (facing either frontwards or towards the ceiling) and the Sub-Woofer just behind the TV and it sounded remarkably good! But, we decided to do it right and mount the Soundbar on top of the TV with the Bracket and placed the Woofer behind the TV and that sounded even better...quite good, in fact. However, the Soundbar Brackets Universal Soundbar Bracket is difficult to set up so that it is rigidly stable. The story is as follows.Although some reviews and the instructional videos that the Bracket Manufacturer provides make Soundbar Installation seem like a one minute affair; we don't agree. We believe that this installation is, in fact, not for the faint of heart! If you are used to building cars or motorcycles it is fine...But, just know that two screws on each side of the TV's back (total of 4) are required in addition to the two notch screws on the Soundbar (total of 6) for the whole installation to be stable. This is NOT what the Manufacturer says...They claim that all you need is one screw on each side of the TV's back in addition to the two notch screws on the Soundbar for the whole thing to be stable.Our SONY Soundbar weighs only ~6 pounds and is only 3 inches high, much less than larger (e.g.; Yamaha) Soundbars which are significantly heavier. Even with the two 2-inch wide 1/8"" thick steel (nicely powder-coated) Brackets only two of our (SONY) screws on the back of our TV matched the Brackets long slots and these could NOT be tightened enough to hold our relatively light Soundbar on the top of our TV from moving side-to-side.  Unfortunately, due to the ""J"" curve of the Brackets (and its long slots) did not match the positions of all 4 of the screws/screw holes on the back of our SONY.We did in fact get lucky and were able to make these Brackets work to mount our Soundbar on the top of our TV, however...  We placed each Bracket vertically, so that the hook of the ""J"" was down with the open side of the ""J"" facing each another. We then overlapped the bottom of each hook of the ""J""s by about 2.5 inches.  This allowed us to catch the bottom outside corner of each ""J"" with the (only the edge of the bottom two SONY back screws, while the top two SONY screws fit correctly in the top third of the two Brackets ""Slots"". In addition, the two slot screws on the Soundbar were fitted to the Soundbar (total of 6). We were able to tighten the lower edge-clamping screws enough in combination with the top properly placed (in slots) screws (total of 4) to hold the bar from moving side-to-side.  But, the Soundbar does move front to back some due to the flexing of the two 2 inch bars. But, that's OK. We stabilized that movement of the Soundbar on the top of the TV with simply a 10 inch band of packing tape on the back of the TV where it meets the Soundbar.We highly recommend laying your HDTV face-down on a clean blanket or bed spread. Do not try to fit these Brackets like demonstrated by the Bracket's Manufacturer with the TV vertical. Assembly, may or may not work depending on where the screw holes are on your HDTV and you will need to experiment. Be safe and do this with your TV's back horizontal like a table.  Good Luck!  Amazon is great...You can always send them back!",1,2,0.04788476,0.2636343,0.6884809

"I've a couple of different Kindles already (yes, buying into the Amazon crack), and this is probably my least favorite of the Kindle covers.  Which isn't to say that it doesn't do its job - the Kindle fits snugly into the cover, and it does protect it.  You've got the whole fake leather thing going on, which means you've got to put up with the pleather odor for a few days once it arrives, and there's nothing really atheistically pleasing that stands out about this cover (design-wise) that stands out.  I'll give it points for leaving all of the buttons/ports easily accessible for the Kindle Fire, but there's basically one display position for your Kindle with this cover (horizontal) and it could be more stable.

"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my son. My son was thrilled with these binoculars. And when I tried them out myself I was impressed.We left the day after Xmas to go on a guided nature tour of Costa Rica.After a few days on the tour one of the guides had a look and noticed that the optics were not aligned. I checked myself and there was a significant double image effect. My son was 12 at the time, not a wild kid, but a normal red blooded boy. It's possible that there was some mis-handling, but he had not dropped them and I don't think any of his handling could be classified as abuse. Besides he really did not have time to do anything abusive to them.I think if you plan to use these for the occasional concert or trip to a national park, etc -- this should work well for you and is a great value.

"This mailer is just enough to mail a 12cm disc (CD or DVD) by itself, without jewel case or any envelope. The weight of this mailer itself is about 15g. With a typical disc (about 15g), it slightly exceeds 28.35g or 1 ounce weight. So, unless you use a particularly lightweight disc, the postage will be $0.81 for US domestic first class, which consists of $0.61 postage for up to 2 ounces plus $0.20 non-machinable surcharge (this is rigid and square, so you definitely need the extra 20 cents).I initially thought that the mailer might be made lightweight to fit in one ounce line with one disc, to save the postage. It isn't so. The postage will be the same with mailers made with more rigid cardboard stock.The mailer's cardboard stock is rather thin and flimsy. Based on my experience with similar mailers I used, I expect a few percents of the discs to be delivered cracked. I wouldn't mail anything but easily duplicatable material in this mailer. In fairness, USPS used to be much better in terms of delivering discs undamaged. A few years ago, I saw a sharp increase in the chance of discs delivered damaged.

I requested that they check the units before sending them, make sure they actually worked.  I recieved two working units.One note on these chargers.

Second, the ""bonus"" USB port will NOT charge the iPad, but did charge my iPod Touch and iPod Classic.

"I have had several Garmin units over my time.  This one was picked up by my company and I needed to purchase something new and meet a price range.  This is a decent GPS.  It has the Bluetooth, so you can have a hands-free conversation.  It has the FM transmitter, which they either need to increase the power or quit selling it.  At least it has a line-out, so you can plug it into your stereo.  It has the SD card slot, which should be SDHC compatible.If I had it to do over again, I would've purchased an older model.  This model didn't seem to keep up with the older version that had the flip up antenna.  You have yourself a second or two by not having to flip the antenna up, but you pay for it with signal.  I was driving around Maryland, near DC, and lost signal over and over and over again.The FM transmitter has been in 2 of the Garmin GPS units that I have purchased.  It is a joke.  It is frustrating.  It is more frustrating than worthwhile.  This is just a company trying to say they offer something that is not really offered.  Search the net, you will see that I am not the only one complaining about this.I use the line-out to push out the audio.  This works consistently and I have been happy with it.  It would be nice to not have to plug in an additional cable, but until stereos get Bluetooth or the FM transmitter is redesigned, that won't be the case.They have an SD card slot on the side of the unit, but it doesn't work with SDHC.  That means that you are limited with how large your SD card can be.  It would be nice to be able to put a 16GB card in the slot and have music to last for your trip across the country or just to not have to swap cards from trip to trip across town.  But, that is not to be the case.  They saved a little money and didn't put in an SDHC compatible reader.It also has the same quirks of any GPS.  It doesn't have a clue where driveways are, it just gets you to the specific address.  This will include sending you for a U-turn instead of just turning left at the light and catching the driveway.  I don't expect any GPS to correct that for a long time.  Mapping the streets is tough enough.  Keeping up with driveways/entries will take a lot.All in all, it's not the worst that's out there.

"Application: The application was not too difficult and followed similar instructions as other screen protectors on the market. A microfiber cloth and a small plastic card were provided to aid in applying the screen protector. Three protectors come in this pack, so you can redo several times if necessary.How it worked: I tried this on my Kindle Touch (KT). I don't think it really does anything besides protecting against scratches. The KT itself is already pretty good in the anti-glare department, so I didn't notice anything too different. If I had to, I'd say that the KT screen was actually a tiny bit better without the screen protector. Many matte screen protectors I've seen marketed for phones and tablets will make the screen blurry, but it didn't seem noticeable with the KT. If you do get bubbles though, they are visible and will look grayish and distracting. I don't think screen protectors are really worth the trouble for the Kindles unless you are really careless with them. I did cut one of the screen protectors to tryout on my phone. It made the screen blurry and did not work much in terms of glare reduction so I would only use this for the eInk Kindles.

I was still able to scroll after I pulled the rubber out, but it was more difficult now to turn the wheel.I was able and willing to live with that, however.And then, a week or so ago, the receiver died. It gets extremely hot once inserted into the USB port, and that's all it does. The mouse itself still looks fine, but without the receiver it's just a piece of electronic junk.What a shame, I really liked this mouse.",1,0,0.9025415,0.08894558,0.008512974

The ear cuffs on the headphones are designed to spin one direction to put on your head, and then spin back to close for storage. About a week into using them, my niece spun them the incorrect way, and the ear piece snapped right off. Unfortunately, no amount of glue/duct tape would keep them together. :) The only thing bad I could say, is maybe it wasn't made the best, but as long as you're very careful in spinning the CORRECT way, they aren't a bad set of headphones.Since then, she has been using the earbuds, and they have worked perfectly.

"At first glance, the Netgear Stora should be the answer to everyone's storage dreams. With photos and mp3's eating up disk space, this should be perfect, but it's not. It feels like it was rushed out the door in order to make a big impact for the holidays.The setup itself is a pain. Compared to other NASes from Western Digital and Maxtor I've used in the past where it's ""a few clicks and done"" to configure, this is unwieldy. There's no option to NOT set up the remote action portion of the software. I don't want to be able to remotely access my storage. The software also tells you to open up firewall ports. But I don't want to. Seriously, this needs to be an option for people to skip the remote configuration. I know, I could spend $20 a year to remotely access my stuff, but I don't want to.The size is nice and holds two drives so you can expand this further. One of the complaints is that this is RAID only (as opposed to JBOD, which adds the storage to what you have). I don't mind that - you can never be too paranoid when it comes to data storage. If you wanted to add another 1TB drive, check Netgear's site for drive compatibility. The front-mounted USB port recognized a 500gb drive I had here just fine, so that's a bonus point.As for streaming audio and video... it works just fine with streaming mp3s, but if you have different file formats (Divx AVIs, for example) they can't be streamed. Sucks. It works just fine with iTunes sharing.The price point is good, but it feels like they pushed it out too quickly without testing it. The drive is loud and the Gigabit Ethernet connection doesn't seem to make this any faster when connected to a Gigabit switch (jumbo frames?). At $200, it should be a killer and something for home use, however, the software kills this thing. I can live with noise and slowness if I'm using it for just storage - but I should be able to stream pretty much any file format off of this.I'm torn with recommending this as a buy or not. If the software and firmware were updated to ditch the remote access portion of the NAS along with updating it so it supports more file formats, then I'd recommend buying it. But at $200, it's tempting, if you want to live with the hassle.",1,0,0.8590586,0.13042445,0.010516917
"I chose this tablet over the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  The Note has hard keys whereas I wanted on screen soft keys (home, back, apps).

"This review is about a PANASONIC DMR-485V DVD/VHS RECORDERAll the stuff everyone else said... locks up, won't read a disc it just recorded, timer just forgets? It's a lot like a teenager that just won't listen. But they're ALL like that! Actually, it seems all digital stuff is like that... ""IF I feel like doing it at all, I'll do it when I'm good and ready."" It's as if you don't even exist sometimes. I can't believe that nobody can (is it can't or won't?) make a reliable DVD recorder.I recently bought a Magnavox MDR515H with a hard drive and sent it back it was such a frustrating POS. I then got a Toshiba DVR670 DVD/VHS Recorder. Looks to be the same lousy firmware as the Magnavox by the menu screens and horrible channel selection method, but I kept it anyway. (I can't keep wasting money on return S&H;!) At least it only records a black silent screen on some of the channels as opposed to most of the channels like the Magnavox, and 5 to 10 seconds can add up when you have to wait that long between every channel change. It can literally take several minutes just to go from a channel at the low end of the tuner like 4-1 to one somewhere in the middle like 20-2. And yes, you have to wait for every single one in between. The Panasonic isn't nearly so bad and the channel selector (especially for timer recordings) is so much easier to use. Also, you can preview the channel you are programming as you set the timer so you know there is actually a channel there. Not possible with those other two units which, btw, don't let you label channels. The Panasonic does. Oh yeah, DVD-RAM discs... GREAT! You can pause live tv then fast forward like a DVR and play back recordings at 1.3x (You think ""Bad Brad"" is fast at normal speed?) with sound and captions, although the video quality can be a little squirrelly depending on the original record speed. Also, some other players read DVD-RAMs (like the Toshiba) so you can move them without having to ""finalize"" the disc. A big disappointment is not being able to record to VHS from a digital signal, especially since we have no analog channels provided on our cable system anymore.So, the Panasonic has some problems, but it is so much better and easier to use than the others. It's too bad when an unreliable unit is the best ""go to"" option you've got, but it is what it is and it ain't gettin' no better. I would hesitantly recommend it keeping that in mind. Also, I found a firmware update a few months ago and it worked reasonably well for a while. Lately it's has become very problematic again so I will try to find a newer update.I threw out a Sanyo D1000 not long ago that I used to think was a PITA, but after dealing with these SOBs I miss it. (Although, I missed a lot of shows that didn't record and threw out a lot of unreadable discs with that one too.) It only had an analog tuner, but I could have at least used it to record off the cable box. Now, Comcast... THERE's a topic for disgruntlement!

"Bought this wireless card shortly before upgrading an XP computer to Windows 7.  I guess I was naive -- I believed the claims that hardware that works on Vista will also work on Windows 7.  When I ran the upgrade advisor, it told me to go to the company website and download an updated driver to install after the upgrade.  I did so, but could only locate a driver for Vista.  Worth a try, I thought.  However, the install program would not even start on my upgraded machine.  I contacted tech support at MSI several days ago by email to find out if an updated driver is in the works -- and did not even receive an automated acknowledgment of my inquiry.  They have not responded to date.As for the XP part -- installed it on a computer that is not far from my router, although on another floor.  Have always had poor signal using an old laptop with a wireless card in that room, but this card picked up a good signal, with nice connection speed.  Instructions were scant and did not explain the options offered in the setup program.  I couldn't get onto my network using the proprietary software program that comes with the card -- partly because it's more complicated than it needs to be, asking questions about the network specifications that the XP configuration utility doesn't require, and whose answers I didn't know.  The install program offers the option of using the wireless zero configuration program, but I didn't realize that is the native utility in XP, so did not initially select it.  I had to activate the XP utility and use it to connect successfully to my network.If I were using this on an XP computer, I would be giving it 5 stars (although I only used it for a few minutes).  However, with the poor support and compatibility issues I'll give it 3 stars.

"As of writing, this product is just too expensive for what it is.Pros:-Quality build. Feels sturdy, the winding mechanism works well, the plugs seem durable.-Does what it says.

"I bought this mouse to use with my Adobe programs because I wanted ultra precision. I had the wireless Logitech MX Revolution but getting in close with Photoshop it tended to ""skip"". The G9 Laser Mouse is exactly what I needed it is smooth and glides. The sensitivity is the best I've had, when zooming in I set the dpi lower and when surfing the internet or gaming I set it all the way up. And you can set three dpi settings so that you can get to them with a push of a button.Now for the bad part. I had the Logitech MX Revolution and the features on that like automatic scroll wheel change from smooth to click was amazing. The G9 has you turn the mouse over and click a button to switch it making the feature almost useless, since turning over the mouse clicking the button and then scrolling takes longer than just using the scroll bar.The number of buttons on the G9 is also underwhelming giving you a Back, Forward, Dpi Up, Dpi Down on top of the standard left click, right click, middle click buttons.The comfort is better on the MX Revolution but the G9 is still soft and smooth and gives you options to change the case to a smaller ""grippy"" top for precision gaming. The option to add weights to give you the perfect feeling is also a good addition.In the future if logitech releases a MX Revolution that is corded or has the G9 smoothness and DPI that will be the perfect mouse.

"I've been wanting one of these cooling mats for my big 17"" HP laptop for awhile. I call it the monster because it's so big and gets so hot and often I use a table rather than work with it on my lap for that reason. So a chill mat definitely is a no-brainer for me.As other reviewers have mentioned, it basically has 3 internal fans that run off the USB ports on the laptop. First big negative for me is that my laptop only has 2 USB ports to begin with, so I am certainly not giving up both of those. In trying it out though, I didn't even see any difference between using two versus just one. So dock a point for the annoying extra USB plug hanging down that doesn't do anything.Next, there's a speed adjustment, but it pretty much goes from high speed (and very noisy) to off. It takes a lot of tweaking to get it on anything other than high or off. It's like 90% of the adjustment wheel is off, and the last 10% is on, so you can guess from that how hard it is to actually adjust the speed. Really frustrating.Other than these issues, it does basically work. It definitely keeps my laptop much cooler and my legs cooler as well when it's on top of them. Like most of these cooling mats, it's fairly noisy, but it's not as big and bulky as some for this size laptop which I appreciate. I don't like the little height knobs on the back of it that stick into my legs when holding it on my lap...it should have something that folds away when used on a lap (hence the word LAPTOP).Overall, it does the job but for the price, these other issues really shouldn't be there and so it's hard for me to recommend it without reservations.",1,2,0.01629129,0.1838348,0.799874

The first time I tried turning it on, I figured out why.I had the same problem as many others, I couldn't get the dial to turn to turn it on and off.  I ended up taking the whole thing apart, pretty easy with a small philips and a smaller straight screw driver.  I found out that you don't have to do that to fix it.  All you need to do is use a very small straight screw driver to pry out the speaker grill(it's lightly glued in), then very gently pop off the outer, chrome ring.  YOU DO NEED TO TAKE OFF THE SPEAKER GRILL FIRST.  There is part of the chrome ring under it that will break off if you don't take the grill off first.

However, the combination of the cord and the extension creates weight. Since the earphones' design places all of the weight on the left side, the left earphone continually loosens from your ear or falls out. If I'm wearing a shirt with a pocket, I tuck part of the cord to take the weight off the earphone. Sony should have included a clip, or adjusted the weight equally on both sides.For those who think that their extension cord is defective because the sound only comes out one side - you've got to force the main cord into the extension. It should snap together. Once you get the main cord's plug fully into the extension it will sound fine from both sides, but you've got to exert a little extra effort.",1,1,0.07695326,0.6976995,0.2253472

"REVIEWER UPDATE 07/31/13In the comments, Tiffany from SquareTrade reached out to me.  After a lengthy conversation, mostly me speaking and Tiffany listening, the matter was resolved.  Highlights of our discussion:1.  When a rep says ""not covered"" request a second opinion.2.  This warranty does not cover accidental breakage.  Tiffany said this was a gray area as the breakage was part of normal operation and processed the claim.  It broke through normal wear and tear, and the 106 one-star reviews on the product shows it is a design defect.  (No - it didn't have any one-stars when I bought it - I was an early adopter.)3.  When in question as to what warranty to buy, call SquareTrade.I did not choose the accident coverage as I believed neither my wife nor I would accidentally break it.  Even so, the accident coverage would have been the better choice despite costing twice as much.I'm glad SquareTrade made it right and I upgraded the stars accordingly (would actually go as high as 3.5 stars), but disappointed it could not be resolved on the first call.  I also changed my mind about future purchases from ""never again"" to ""neutral/maybe"".Five stars to Tiffany for excellent customer service.ORIGINAL REVIEWThey state: ""We'll repair or replace your item in five business days or less after we've received it, or your plan is free"" which is exactly what happened.  I bought ""Cyber Acoustics 30-Pin iPod Speaker Dock (CA-461)"" from Amazon, and bought a Square Trade Warranty.  When the device failed (the ipod connector pulled out of the unit), I called SquareTrade, who informed me I was not covered and refunded by money.  No repair/replacement offered - just a refund.  The warranty states ""This warranty is only valid for new items with mechanical and electrical failures that occur during normal use"" - SquareTrade states unplugging an ipod from the docking station is not a normal mechanical function.  Really?!?!  How else does one mechanically unplug an ipod from a dock?This really sucks as I have two other SquareTrade warranties on items and now have no confidence they will cover those items either.  I won't be buying another one of these, ever.  Better to know I'm not covered than think I am and get the claim denied.",1,0,0.4978026,0.19843929,0.30375817
"I purchased screen protectors for my Samsung Galaxy tablet so when I bought my iPad, I ordered screen protectors but quickly discovered that they are not needed.  The screen protectors work if they are held in place by tablet covers.  However, the smart cover I ordered for my iPad does not hold the screen protector in place so it always slides.  But, the iPad doesn't seem to need screen protection and since I absolutely love my leather smart cover for the iPad, I ended up putting the screen covers in a drawer.  Lesson learned.

"I just got this cover for my Kindle Fire HD  today and already I don't care for it and have ordered something else.  It does fit just fine but some of my apps like Words With Friends only turn in one particular direction and because of the little emblem it makes the cover upside down or backwards.  I would live with that if it wasn't for the fact that it stinks so bad (strong chemical odor) so it's definitely going to be given to someone who doesn't mind the smell and just got a Kindle Fire for Christmas (my son).  The vendor was fine and I don't blame them so that's why I opted not to return it, but I really don't like it.  If you want a nice case, try the Supcase.  My Mom has that and it smells almost like leather and no emblem on the front so direction isn't an issue.2/1/13:  Just an update that the stinky smell of the cover is beginning to fade - not nearly so bad.  I'm still giving this 3 stars becase of the placement of the emblem, making you have to hold it upside down and backwards for some apps, but in all honesty it's not that bad, unless you might be really odor sensitive.  I have still bought another cover without the little emblem that was even less expensive than this one.  So maybe if they lowered the price a bit and you could get past the first week of the stinky smell, it is a nice color and feels pretty good and has all of the right slots in the right places for the Kindle Fire HD. I would still recommend, however, that you get one with a darker color on the inside because this light gray may get dirty with all of the handling it gets while I'm reading or playing games.",1,0,0.5552297,0.42501253,0.019757753

"While I was impressed with the purported capabilities of this player, I was skeptical about how they would really work once I got it home.  Setup was rather easy.  The wireless dongle found my network and got me signed in the first time, but then inexplicably failed the next time I sat down to watch netflix.  It took 3 power cycles to get it back.Each time I power on the unit, it takes up to a minute or longer to ""grab"" wireless signal before you can access Pandora or Netflix.  The menus in each are clunky and slow to respond.  What's worse, compared to my XBOX 360 in the same entertainment center running on wireless which was able to get HD video quality over Netflix, the Samsung could barely muster 2 or 3 bars of signal.  I tried repositioning the dongle on the front of the player with no change in signal strength even though it was practically in sight of the wireless router 20 feet away.  This alone was unforgivable because what's the point of watching s movie on your large screen when you can only get it in low-quality?  I'd rather watch it on my XBOX with its quicker menu and much faster wireless connection.Pandora is an awesome service, so I was really happy to see it integrated into the player. The same issue that ruined Netflix, ruined Pandora.  After you waited the minute or so for wireless connection, Pandora took a while to load and kept logging me out so I had to manually enter my account info each time I wanted to listen.  With the clunky menu and slow responding controls, this takes time.  I'd just as soon purchase a Wadia 170 iTransport and plug in my ipod touch over wireless for Pandora.  At $379, the Wadia played better sound and the ipod touch took less than a second to find my wireless connection while the Samsung took ages.Video quality was good, but no better than the Panasonic BD35 that it was replacing.  Worse still, the Samsung would NOT output 24p video to my Panasonic PZ850, while the BD35 would.  When you select it in the Samsung's menu, it attempts the connect and then reverts back to regular video with no 24p engaged.  Load times were not noticeably faster than the BD35 though,admittedly, I did not time it.Too many companies release products that they think the consumer wants before they are ready to be put out.  We get to deal with the kinks and wait for a firmware upgrade.  This Samsung isn't fully baked, so if I were you, I'd wait a while.

The DVD player had only an RCA connection, having only one RCA connection on the Samsung TV forced me to change the ROKU connection to an HDMI cable. It was then I discovered how stiff the HDMI cable was, when the ROKU box would no longer sit flat on the stand beneath the TV because the torque in the cable wanted to flip the ROKU over. Making a loop in the HDMI cable redirected the torque and allowed the ROKU to sit flat, although there are visible loops of cable both beneath and to one side of the TV.

I want to start off before the review of the tivo stream and inform people that may have initial connection issues that I did have a trendnet N router the cheap kind that sells around $30 since I was having connection issues but I replaced with a new Netgear WNDR4300(the 3700 works very well too). This did help the Tivo stream make a connection and this review was written after I changed the router. I added this tidbit in case some people are having initial connection issues with their Tivo stream and cant figure out why it wont work. It also was a big improvement with netflix streaming and multiple people doing things on the internet at once.TIVO STREAM REVIEWThe tivo stream is great now that you can bring your shows on the go and if you have a pad can watch your shows in rooms that dont have a tv. Especially if you want to watch the game while working in the garage or have that emergency bathroom break and dont want to pause the show and make everyone wait for you to come back! I think for $130 they should have added a slingbox type feature which would enable you to download your shows remotely or via cellular(then add a lower resolution that would be cropped for mobile traveling).*** Now the bad and why Tivo should look at this and get some fixes going or have their employees use this product to get faster feedback to them and make some fixes****.1) Every few times you start the app on your i device and try to download a show it will have to reconnect to the tivo stream as there is an error and this takes a minute for the i device to find it and do a 14 second video buffer. 2) When you play a show it will give an error playback 1-3 times before starting the show. This happens at least once out of 3 shows played. 3) When you stop a show or your screen shuts off due to the time that you have set for screen autolock you have to start the show all over instead of being given the choice to RESUME- WHY THIS IS NOT AN OPTION I DONT UNDERSTAND. For these reasons I feel that it is still a beta product and they are charging a premium price for the device. If Tivo fixes this and adds a slingbox type feature without charging it would be worth the asking price. Till then it should be $79 tops. If anyone else is having issues please post your comments so Tivo is aware. Dont get me wrong its a great compliment to the Tivo but they have some bugs and features to work out to make the experience even better.,1,2,0.0028312567,0.006154774,0.99101394

"People may not realize how much headphones can ""color"" the sound of their music, if they have nothing else to compare them to.Recently I was looking for a set primarily for classical music (although I listen to rock and electronic as well...Lacrimosa, Apoptygma Berzerk, And One, Anathema, VNV Nation etc etc), and I stumbled upon this set in a nearby store.  While electronic music sounded great (thanks to the exaggerated bass), classical music often sounded muddy in the lows (very evident during one of my favorite Mahler symphonies), and not very natural sounding (meaning that violin during that Sibelius Violin Concerto may sound ""off"" and not quite ""violin like"").What I ended up doing was returning these and upping my budget to double this price and buying the exceptionally better AKG K701, along with a temporary Fiio E3 amp (you NEED an amp for those, unlike this Bose set which play fine out of an Ipod or portable CD Player).  For the classical music lover, if at all possible that's the route I recommend going with.  The AKGs sound heavily with well recorded classical music (but at double the price of these), while this Bose set sounds colored and unnatural.  If that's not possible, there are still many other brands (Sennheiser, AKG, Grados, etc) that offer much better at this price range.  Keep in mind that some are better than others at different styles of music (ie, this Bose set unnaturalness with regard to classical music).However, one thing not forgivable with this set is the insultingly cheap materials used in building them.

"You're watching TV in the living room and decide to fetch a snack from the kitchen. The landline phone rings and you answer it, quickly realizing you'll be in the kitchen for a while. You pull out your iPhone and, using the Bluetooth connection to the Zentral Home Command, you pause your TiVo or mute your volume.You want to push a button on your iPhone and have your TV turn on, your TiVo listing appear, and your home theater processor power up.You'd like a simple remote control that has only the 5 or 6 buttons that you regularly use without the 73 other buttons that you've never even pushed. You've tried the Harmony remotes and find them complex and difficult to deal with, or find that their battery is always dead because noone replaced them on their power pod.If you fit into one of these categories, the Zentral Home Command is a reasonable place to turn. I didn't have the difficulties experienced by other reviewers in getting the unit ready to run. The bluetooth connection took place within a few seconds and my iPhone automatically went to the App Store to fetch the proper App. The App ran with no apparent difficulties on my iPhone 4. I was quickly able to connect to a Sony TV, the Motorola cable box, and the Oppo Bluray player. My Sunfire processor was not contained in the built-in capabilities so I dealt with that separately.I then went to zentralapp.com and was easily able to configure the buttons in the exact layout that I desired. Each component has several pages of buttons so I could put all the DVR buttons for the cable box on one page (if they weren't there already) and all the channel selection buttons for the TV Guide on another page. For those situations where the Zentral AV remote doesn't have the function you want, of if there is no code controlling a given device (as with my Sunfire), you go through a learning routine. The Zentral learns the code from your original remote. This is a somewhat laborious process, particularly for a complex remote, but the process works.So far, so good. The Zentral has a bright blue LED on the front panel. It blinks when connecting, remains on when connected, and turns off when the connection is broken. I keep my iPhone in my pocket. If I go outside, then return to the house, the Bluetooth connection has been lost. I then cannot use the remote until I go to Settings on my iPhone and manually reconnect the Bluetooth. This is one of the downfalls of the product (yet it seems to be a BlueTooth software issue on the iPhone rather than an implementation issue of the Zentral). The blue LED is particularly vivid and strong. I found it annoying in a darkened room and it would be nice to be able to turn off the LED. I finally decided that I could put the Zentral behind me so I wouldn't see the blue LED, but then the LED was shining directly at my TV and I could see the reflected light in the picture.The Zentral needs to be able to ""see"" each remote input window on all your components. It comes with a wire string that attaches to the IR window on each component (up to 6). The wire string plugs into the back of the module as does an AC cord. The wire string works for your component stack but your TV will likely be too far away to reach. You'll therefore use the visual connection between the Zentral and the TV. Unfortunately, this means that the Zentral must be placed so that it can see the TV while still being able to be connected physically to the remote wiring for your audio/video stack. And there's that AC cord to deal with as well. Where will you put the module?That's where we run into trouble with the Zentral. If you have a small TV that's right next to all your home theater components, this unit will work well. Since there's Bluetooth connectivity, you don't have to have your iPhone in a line-of-sight with the Zentral, but the Zentral needs line-of-sight connections to any components that don't have the little IR wiring attached to their remote windows. As your system grows larger, you may encounter placement difficulties.The bottom line is that the Zentral works quite well at its intended goal. BUT: it needs an improved Bluetooth implementation that will cause the iPhone to automatically reconnect even if you've walked out of range since the last time the module was connected. And it would be nice to discard the requirement for an AC connection. That would allow the unit to simply sit in the middle of the room, or next to you on the table with line-of-sight connections to all my components (so long as we can kill the bright blue light). That said, the price point is right and if your room is configured appropriately, this isn't a bad deal at all.",1,2,0.015261914,0.027408965,0.95732915

"My main commitment is to review electronics products for the Linux community.  I tested this webcam on the Skype program on Linux Mint OS 9.  The webcam worked without needing to install drivers and was essentially plug and play.  The CD driver disk did not include Linux software drivers and so it was good that it was plug and play.  The motion tracking was blurry even when the movements made to test it were not very fast.  The picture was okay, but was not very detailed, and the colors did not feel realistic, but were close enough to what you would expect to be believable.  The webcam is definitely not high definition.  I found the built in microphone to work well.  My voice sounded clear on the echo test that Skype has built into its software and service.  All in all, the microphone worked as expected and did seem to remove many unwanted sounds from the environment, but not perfectly (I do not know of any noise canceling software that does this perfectly).  The video resolution is rated at 800x600 for video and 1290x960 for picture taking.  The frame speed is 30 fps.My assessment is that this webcam is okay and it works.  I give it three stars, because when I tested it against the Microsoft Lifecam VX-5000, it did not do well.  The VX-5000 had superior image quality, had better low light handling (excellent), had better motion tracking (no blurring), and had about the same abilities for the condenser microphone.  I would have liked to say that the Creative Live Cam was good for its cost and is an affordable low definition basic webcam, but when I looked up both their prices on Amazon, the VX-5000 was actually a few bucks cheaper!  The Creative Live! has a nice rubber grip on its holding clamp that other webcams do not have and does fold up well for transport.  It is designed to clamp on to a notebook computer, a desktop LCD, and is firm enough to be free standing.  My sense is that it is a good webcam that is a little dated.  It would have been the standard sometime ago, before the HD webcams became more affordable.  I could imagine someone picking one up at a yard sale or thrift store and being happy with it for most purposes.  There is also a chance that it would work better on Windows, but this is something I cannot really test nor can I evaluate the software that it comes with for Windows.  What I do know is that, all other things being literally equal, the VX-5000 (and a number of Logitech Webcams that I had also reviewed before) work better in the Linux environment.",1,1,0.4758892,0.48697823,0.03713257

"From the many positive reviews, I had high hopes for this. There are a number of frustrating features with this. It does pick up good strong signals when it's aimed at a station's transmitter.Good points- Pretty good reception.- It has dipoles too, which are good for VHF stations, if the stations are nearby.Not so good points- The whole thing is unstable, and keeps falling over. It should be weighted (heavier).- When it does fall over, which is often, the metal antenna elements can bend easily. They're pretty easy to bend back into shape.- The coax cable comes out of the bottom of the antenna, and it must be routed through the base. The cable doesn't want to stay put, making the antenna even more likely to tip over.- The shape is unwieldy. That's a function of the antenna elements, inherent in the design. But it makes it awkward to rotate the antenna to point to different stations.- When the dipole antennas are extended, the whole thing is very top-heavy. It's *really* easy to tip over.The signal amplifier comes as a separate unit that you connect inline with the coax cable. I haven't found that it makes much difference in reception. If the station is too weak to pick up, the amplifier isn't likely to magically fix it.",1,0,0.700626,0.29035625,0.009017733

"I was intending on using this with theGoPro Head Strap Mount for HERO CamerasBut turns out it wont keep it afloat.

Took it to the bottom of the pool (6ft deep) and still got back up to the top.So I will need to put another float or something on the head strap mount (there is a flat piece of plastic on the back of it) that I can maybe mount a small float to assist this main one.Im somewhat disappointed since the original GoPro Orange float supposedly has no issues holding the GoPro head strap mount attached.

"I purchased this folio because I thought it would be a bit of a tighter fit than a couple of the others I have tried out. It does have a tighter fit, but in that it lacks some of the features that I would have liked to have.Really the only part about this folio that gives it a slight edge on the competition is that it does fit the Nexus 10 a bit better. There are some pretty significant downfalls though. The keyboard looks like it is the standard Android folio size, has a super small right shift key, which I use all the time, not good. However, comparing this one to another I got the keyboard is not removable. I really do think a removable keyboard should be included in any folio that has been used by the company selling them. The worst part about this folio for me is that the back stand that folds out is tucked under the same flap that holds the tablet in place, making it easy a pain to expand the flap and put it back.All in all I had the Nexus in this tablet for about 10 minutes before I packed it back up and sent it back to Amazon.

"This case wasn't as cool as I thought it might be. While it definitely protects everything, there are a few things that could be better. One, it makes the Asus T100 bigger and bulkier than it already is, which sort of takes away from the hybrid tablet/laptop thing. Second, it doesn't have anything to hold it together when it is closed, it just sort of folds over itself.

"I waited three weeks to receive this tv. And what a disappointment it was. There is no backlight control on the video portion of the main menu. Therefore the picture always looks too bright and the colors a bit washed out. I tried turning off the dynamic luminance control which helped a little bit.No RGB control. So this tv at times shows a picture that has too much of a blue or green hue at times. No way to adjust it. Blacks are not deep at all. Picture itself appears grainy even after increasing the sharpness settings.This TV picture is just plain ""off"". You can see the colors are never right, there is always an imbalance of red, green, or blue. Grainy detail in background. And washed out screen overall due too much backlight.These picture quality problems might have been fixed if their proper adjustment options are available. However you will not have access to fix them since you can not make any adjustments to the backlight and RGB levels.This TV has inferior picture quality to my Sceptre 37"" TV and my Insignia 39"" tv and they are no name brand tv's as well. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere if you are looking for a tv with at least ""good"" picture quality. This TV does not meet that requirement. I've chose to return this TV.Update: After doing some research online, I found if you go to the main menu and press four digits 0000 it will take you into a second menu which allows you to adjust the backlight under ""other settings"" and you can also adjust the RGB levels under the ""color temperature"" option. I'm going to try to do some further calibrating before I decide if I am going to return it or not.Update #2: I found another option in the secondary options menu found with code 0000 on the main menu. You go to other options, then video curve this option allows you to make adjustments to the high level of contrast and brightness levels this TV comes with out of the box which causes the washed out picture effect. After decreasing the factory settings for brightness and contrast under Video curve option this TV's picture finally came alive.Contrast pops against a darker background now. No more washed out background. Brightness level is now balanced so TV does not have the gray hazy effect it originally had out of the box.This Tv has good potential. But you have to show alot of patience with adjustments. My main gripe with this TV is all of the adjustment options should have been readily available in the main menu. But alas, if you press OOOO on the main menu, you will have access to all the additional adjustment options you need to get a great picture out of this Tv.Update #3 This TV still shows a grainy picture no matter how high I adjust the sharpness settings. I find myself having to put on my glasses just to watch it which I have never had to do with any other TV. TV can show a good picture at times but the blacks just are not deep. Nightime picture looks grey and washed out. TV's contrast appears dull not matter what the setting. TV has the lowest contrast ratio of any 40"" LED TV I've looked at.I've decided to return this TV last week and I since purchased a Sharp 40"" LED tv. So my journey continues. If the Sharp does not work out I will just pay up and get a Samsung 40"" LED Tv which I know has superior picture quality albeit at a inflated price.

"The other positive reviews you will find here are accurate. This device has plenty of muscle. You're getting a beefy Broadcom BCM4708A0 chip running at 800MHz, 256 Memory and 128 Flash memory, the WIFI chipset is a Broadcom BCM4352 for a/c @ 900 and a Broadcom BCM43217 for b/g/n @ 300 transfer rate.There was a huge issue with 2.4GHz WIFI slowing to a crawl and dropping packets that required you to reboot this router every other day. The latest firmware supposedly resolves this but I still here complaints that it has not resolved for some.At this time I highly recommend the Netgear Smart WiFi Router AC1750 Dual Band Gigabit (R6300v2) instead of this ASUS router.Here are the 3 major problems in my opinion that you should be aware of  -#1 - The latest ASUS routers have troubles with many Android devices and 5GHz WIFI! Google it. You will find this problem is pervasive with the latest AC routers from ASUS. You either cannot get your Android device (Nexus 7 tablet, Kindle, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4, etc.) to work on the 5GHz WIFI frequency or you some have been able to connect with crazy settings and tweaks done at the cost of causing problems for other non-Android devices trying to connect via 5GHz. ASUS has not resolved this problem yet. Don't know if they will either!#2 - At over $120, you might as well spend the extra $30-40 and get the Netgear R6300v2! Because for that extra money you get the following - a Broadcom BCM4708A0 chip @800MHz, 256 memory, 128 flash memory and a WIFI chipset of Broadcom BCM4360 + BCM4331 a/c @1300 and b/g/n @450 respectively. These are the newer chips that are not as buggy and perform better. I have also seen this item on sale on Amazon for around $135! At that price this is a no-brainer folks!#3 - I see a lot of major retailers are suddenly no longer selling this device. That means there is either a version 2 coming that will correct these problems or another product altogether. In other words, 'something isn't right' and you're going to be buying the obsolete, defective past that will probably never get fixed.If you really want top of the line for $200 (or around $170 on sale) the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 R7000. It gives you a Broadcom BCM4709A0 @1000MHz 256 memory 128 flash memory and a WIFI chipset of Broadcom BCM4360 x2 for a/c @1300 and b/g/n @600.The Asus RT-AC68U (their top of the line flagship router) gives you this Broadcom BCM4708A0@800  256 memory 128 flash memory and WIFI chipsets of Broadcom BCM4360 x 2 for a/c @1300 and b/g/n @600. But the price for that is currently $210 !!!!!!! With Android bugs mentioned above still unresolved! Ridiculous! In ASUS's defense I will say that their router firmware is packed with way more features and options than the Netgear firmware. So if you are in the market for a truly full featured product...the ASUS may still be the way to go. But you would also just be better off getting the Netgear and putting DD-WRT firmware on it and getting tons more features!Let me be clear - I am a huge ASUS products fan. They do good stuff! I love their motherboards and video cards and other products. These routers are also really good!

"I work for a living as a second part time job, driving car service and limo. I use navigation extensively and not just a casual user, so I look for all the smallest details that are available. I pay attention to the features and if they are useful and easy to access without waste of time. Also, how accurate the instructions from point A to point B are is very important to me, especially when I am with the customer. I have come to conclusion that this is by far the best one that I have used so far. I had an older Garmin for a while, then switched to TomTom XL 3.5 and had that one for about 3.5 years. Loved it and had no issues with it, but the power button broke and after 3 years who would complain right, but now that I have upgraded to VIA 1505 TM with unlimited traffic and maps, not to mention other features that I will describe further, I am sold. It is an amazing navigation with all that is required to get the job done. Some of the features that I find useful and new from the previous model.Besides the obvious, bigger screen, here is what I like in addition to what I already had.Pluses:1. It has speed limits, even in the inner city and street area, not just on the highway. Great and useful feature.2. Accuracy on the address has improved and it actually shows you if the house or a building on the right or the left. Extremely useful when you are searching in the dark and never been there.3. Smaller than the XXL 5 inch navigation, lighter and thinner, but the screen size is exactly the same.4. Traffic is to the point and to the minute accurate. I tested, tried it and it is absolutely fantastic.5. Probably the best feature that they have improved, but it doesn't lose signal inside the tunnels and under long overpasses. Shows you what needs to be done all the way through. Also, when you turn it on, it find the signal faster than the previous models, even the XXL 5 inch model. Via is truly up to speed.6. While you are driving, alerts and suggests that there might be a faster alternate route. It is up to you to choose it or not, but the choice is a great way to decide, taking the guessing out of the formula and also calculates the traffic in and makes recommendations and shows incident explanations. Great features.7. A feature that I am not yet too familiar with, but I think something that will be useful in the long run. It alerts you if there are traffic cameras. I am not clear on if it is accurate or not yet, but will look into it further when I use it for work again. Nevertheless, it is there and seems like a useful little perk.The only Minus: They put the attachment clamp attached to the navigation and there is a few problems that I see here.1. If the clamp breaks, you can't attach the navigation and to replace the clamp, you have to replace the entire unit.2. Every time I want to take it off, so that it is not for prying eyes to admire and steal, I have to take off the entire unit and then reattach it to the windshield again via suction clamp. Not a big deal, but I liked when you could snap the nav in and out without detaching the suction unit on the glass.Revised Minuses and added changes to this review ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:After have been driving with this navigation for a few months now, I have found some problems. Major problems. Not sure it is the new upgrade of the 9.5 software or VIA model, but here is what the problem is. I started to experience loss of signal when I shut the unit off. It started to take longer and longer to find the signal once the system has been shut off. I decided to update the unit with the latest suggestions from TomTom and now besides various times that it takes to find the signal, the system losses the signal every couple of minutes. Sometimes for a little while and sometimes for long periods of time. My previous pluses are slowly disappearing and if the company has a suggestion or way to fix this, I will update this review, but at this point, I would not recommend this as highly as I originally have. As I have mentioned, it might not be the VIA model or it might be only the via model, but I didn't have this specific and very serious problem with any of the XL and XXL models.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Overall, extremely satisfied and so happy that I accidentally got this model as oppose to XXL. I originally got it because VIA is a newer model, but now very happy that I have.",1,2,0.00042552265,0.0010073724,0.99856704

"My Sony Walkman came with a thumb sized ""light spot"" blemish on the display screen.  The screen is still visible underneath, it just appears brighter than the surrounding area if that makes sense.  I don't know what caused it, and I need to send it for repair.  However, that aside - the blemish is only annoying when you are watching videos and I suppose I could get away with not sending it in, but it's annoying.EDIT 5/2/12 - Not expensive to repair.  After checking with Sony all I needed to do was send it back in the original packaging and they are fixing it free of charge.  I have to pay shipping however.  I will update when I get this back to let you know how long it took to do repairs and if they were done properly.EDIT 5/12/12 - Got a notification parts needed to fix the Walkman were on back order, no date given on when I could expect it, just a ""Please be patient"".EDIT 5/29/12 - After saying we'd have it back in 8-10 business days around the 14th I STILL don't have it back and they just send me automated messages with no new information.  Getting frustrated.  I'm downgrading my original outlook from optimistic to negative.  This thing better come back pristine.EDIT 6/2/12- got the walkman back and repaired. It seems ok but now it loses wifi connectivity for no reason and it did not do that before.  I don't know if this is something else that is wrong or if it is just a small hickup on my end.

It really takes no time at all to familiarize yourself with the controls.The sound quality is AMAZING, as one would expect if you use decent quality headphones, and I like the fact that there is also a built in speaker in case you don't want to use headphones - but the quality on that speaker is a little lacking - I won't fault Sony too much for that.  It's still pretty awesome to have that feature because my other MP3 players have not had it certainly.At 32gig, which seems like a lot you are getting a lot of space but I had a lot of movies and so I rapidly ate through all the space and didn't have enough room for my music collection - so I'll have to be a bit more sparing I guess... but 32gig would be enough for the average human.  Plus with the WiFi, and a netflix account I guess you can get movies streaming.It's got all the bells and whistles you could want, but no camera - which it seems like they could have thrown in there easily enough.

"I really want to give it a 3 1/2 stars.  This camera is worth the money  Although, if you're left handed like myself, keeping a steady hand while holding with your right hand takes practice.  The movie quality is a nitch above average.  Filming in High Def looks great, but takes a LOT of memory on your card. Filming in the other formats does the job for casual recordings.  Filming inside without proper lighting can be an issue.  This camera requires a LOT of light to look clean and crisp.  the more light, the better the picture looks. Filming outside is great during the day.  The software that comes with this is not user friendly.  Wish they did a better job with that.  you may want to invest in an external Hard drive.  Also, to capture a lot of film, I recommend 4GB of flash or higher.  Especially for HD recording.  4GB for Normal recording is more than sufficient.  But you didn't buy this for Normal recording.  You bought it 1- for it's size 2- High Definition recording. or vice versa.  Other than the limitations with filming in Low or dim lighting, this camera is cool to have for those special moments at the zoo, or vacations and anywhere else outside.  Venture indoors and you will notice some grainy filming even in High Def.  One more thing that may or may not be of concern...  After opening the package and reading the ""Important Information"" section of the booklet, I read something about ""... some materials made in the camera are known to cause cancer in the state of California..."" or something like that.

"The hardware on this drive is pretty good, but the software and service are a mess.The drive was released with a serious bug in the firmware.  OK, it happens.  But their implementation has a couple big problems:(1) Rather than creating a burnable ISO, they just offer an executable file - you have to know how to create your own DOS boot disk to run it; that's ridiculous, most people can't do that.  They need to give people an ISO, ready to burn and boot.(2) After you patch the firmware, THE FIRMWARE VERSION NUMBER DOESN'T CHANGE!  What!?  So when you get a new drive with 1AQ10001 firmware, you have no way of knowing if it's the patched firmware or the buggy firmware.

"I'm writing this review after having used this product for three months.I'll open with the most immediate con: I had to return the first keyboard I received due to a failure in the keyboard controller. Certain key combinations just stopped working and it definitely turned out to be a defective product. The problem wasn't apparent immediately - it spontaneously developed one day after around three weeks. It was within 30 days, so Amazon picked up the old one and sent out a new one free of charge.The mouse is fantastic - exactly what you'd expect from Logitech. I've had zero problems with it in the three or so months I've been using it, and both mice (from the returned set as well as the new one) worked perfectly fine. I'm a tall person and it fits me quite well. It feels comfortable and not too heavy.The keyboard lacks any sort of built-in lights to indicate whether Caps Lock, Num Lock, or Scroll Lock is on. Okay, I get it, you want to save as much power as possible with a wireless keyboard. However, the included software for the computer that effectively fills this job by showing an icon on screen has a tendency to crash. I've just disabled it altogether as I quickly grew tired of an error report window blocking out my screen.The function keys are awkwardly grouped in threes instead of fours. F1-F3, F4-F6, F7-F9, and F10-F12. This is contrary to every computer I've used before, and I'm at fault for not more carefully looking at the product. I have no idea why such a design decision would be made - standards exist for a reason, and deviating from them isn't always a good thing. I've gotten used to it but it's definitely an adjustment that not all people will be willing to make.Judging by the failure of my first unit and the design in general, I just think Logitech cannot do low-priced tech very well.

There is not enough clearance at the bottom when you have the keyboard attached to actually open and close the unit.  This would not have been as much of a problem on the TF100 as their latching system for the keyboard was much more robust and held it in 2 places.

"I purchased the Canon ELPH 100 HS camera last year to try out the Canon HS System.  I was impressed with the relatively clean-looking images that can be taken in low light, compared to the noticeably noisy images taken with my older cameras.  However, when I zoomed in on parts of the images to look at details, the images were soft and lacking the detail I wanted.  The ELPH 100 HS also did not have an optical zoom for video - only a digital zoom, and only if the still image aspect ratio is set at 4:3.  I considered getting the ELPH 300 HS, which had a 24mm wide angle lens and which did have optical zoom for video, but I decided to go for the models with the newer DIGIC 5 processor, which Canon described as follows:""The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 16.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor in the PowerShot ELPH 110 HS digital camera incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free images.""Based on the representation that the DIGIC 5 processor ""provides a major boost in noise reduction,"" I decided to pre-order the ELPH 110 HS at $249 on Amazon.com. - the 310 HS has a longer zoom lens range, but starts at 28mm and did not have the 24mm wider angle that I wanted.  The 110 HS is also available in black, whereas the 100 HS and the 310 HS did not have a black model.  The 310 HS also has the DIGIC 4 processor, not the newer DIGIC 5 processor that provided the ""major boost in noise reduction.""  Then I read the review by PC Magazine:""I used Imatest to measure the sharpness of photos captured by the Elph 110 HS, and the results were actually quite good. We consider a sharp image to be one that contains a center-weighted average of 1,800 lines per picture height, and the 110 HS exceeded that--recording 2,189 lines. In this regard the camera ran circles around the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27 ($229.95, 2.5 stars), a camera that only managed 1,548 lines.High ISO performance was another matter entirely. We consider a clean image to be one that contains less than 1.5 percent noise. The Elph 110 HS was only able to keep noise under this threshold through ISO 200, a surprisingly low setting.  That said, it only registered about 1.6 percent at ISO 400 and ISO 800, so it isn't going to produce terribly grainy photos at higher ISO settings. That's the good news. The bad news is that the camera applies some pretty aggressive noise reduction to hit even these just-ok numbers. Detail is slightly diminished at ISO 400, but you can still make out textures and fine lines in the image. At ISO 800 it's bad, and at ISO 1600 it's pretty terrible--any semblance of texture is gone from your photo by that point.  The Canon PowerShot Elph 310 HS does a much better job both in terms of image noise and preservation of detail--it keeps noise under 1.5 percent through ISO 800, while managing to do a great job with image detail through ISO 400. At ISO 800 it's not that bad at all, although at ISO 1600 the 310 HS is also a victim of some heavy-handed noise reduction.. . . .The PowerShot Elph 110 HS is a good compact camera, but not a great one. Its lens is sharp, but Canon's decision to cram 16 megapixels onto a tiny sensor results in noisy images at higher ISO settings. The camera attempts to counteract this with noise reduction, but only serves to kill detail in photos at higher ISOs. This won't be a problem on smaller-size screens, but if you want to share your photos on larger LCDs or prints, the lack of texture and detail at higher ISO settings will be noticeable.Canon also turns out to be its own worst enemy here--if the PowerShot 310 HS wasn't available for a mere $10 more, the 110 HS would be easier to recommend. The 310 HS, which earned our Editors' Choice award for midrange compact cameras, features a nearly identical design and a more impressive 8x zoom lens. It does have fewer megapixels and its lens doesn't provide the extra-wide 24mm field of view of the 110 HS, but when you consider the noise reduction that the 110 HS requires to shoot images at ISO 800 and above, you really aren't losing much in terms of image quality when shooting in anything but bright light.""This review was disappointing - apparently, instead of producing a ""major boost in noise reduction,"" the DIGIC 5 processor in the 110 HS was noisier than the DIGIC 4 processor in the 310 HS.  Now the question was whether I should cancel my pre-order of the 110 HS.  I put off the decision, because the ""release date"" for the 110 HS was not until March 31, 2012.  On March 30, I noticed that the price had dropped by $20, so I decided to cancel my pre-order.  But then I saw that my order of the 110 HS at the original price of $249 was labeled as having been shipped, so it was too late to cancel.  [UPDATE JUNE 30, 2012 -- two months after the release date, the price of the ELPH 110 HS has dropped by $50 or twenty percent -- it does make my decision to pre-order the camera and not cancel the pre-order in time look pretty bad -- that will be the last time I pre-order from Amazon.com a new Canon camera model.  UPDATE AUGUST 5, 2012 -- four months after the release date, the price of the black ELPH 110 HS has dropped by another $30 or a total of $80 or thirty-two percent from the original $249 that I paid!  If I had known, I would have waited four months to save $80 or thirty-two percent.]Since receiving the 110 HS on April 2, 2012, I have been using it as my everyday carry camera - it is as thin and light as my 100 HS.  The images taken in bright daylight look fine to me.  The images taken at higher ISOs do look a bit noisy, but they are sharper than the images taken with my 100 HS.  When I zoomed in on the images in the camera and on the computer, I could see more detail, even in the images taken indoors.  So there still is the trade off between sharpness and noise - on the balance, I prefer the additional sharpness that I get with the 110 HS, even though there is more noticeable noise.  In addition, the 110 HS provides the wider 24mm angle and provides optical zoom during video.Unfortunately, the 110 HS is the same as the 100 HS regarding the limitation on the use of digital zoom - digital zoom is only available at the 4:3 still image aspect ratio, while I prefer to shoot at the 3:2 still image aspect ratio to match the 4 X 6-inch prints that I usually order.  I was surprised to find that the images taken with the digital zoom looked better than the images taken at the maximum optical zoom and cropped on the computer to match the magnification of the digital zoom, so now I set the camera at the 4:3 still image aspect ratio with the digital zoom turned on in case I want to take quick snapshots with the digital zoom.  I compared images of a FedEx truck taken through an office opened window with the digital zoom of the 110 HS and with a 70-300mm (at 300mm or the 35mm equivalent of 450mm) lens on a Nikon D5100.  The image taken with the D5100 was less noisy and sharper than the image taken with the digital zoom of the 110 HS, but all of the letters and numbers on the side of the truck could be read in the digital zoom image taken with the 110 HS, except the Grumman name plate on the side of the truck, which could be read only in the image taken with the D5100.  I was pleased to learn that I could take usable photos with the 110 HS when I am not carrying the DSLR and zoom lens with me.If you are looking for a thin, light, and not too expensive [UPDATE -- especially at the $169.99 price as of Aug. 5, 2012; on Nov. 29, 2012, the prices on Amazon.com range from $129 to $179 depending on the color of the camera] everyday carry camera with reasonable sharpness, with a lens with the 24mm angle of view at the wide end of the zoom, and in the color black, the ELPH 110 HS may suit your needs.  I decided to keep the 110 HS, which is my fifth Canon compact camera (but the first one in black).  The 110 HS is a good compact camera that is my current everyday carry camera to have handy for quicky snapshots of various things and people, but, as PC Magazine said, it is ""not a great one.""  If images with lower noise are desired, there are other camera models around this price range and size that should be considered and, of course, there are more expensive cameras with bigger sensors that will provide images with lower noise.",1,0,0.51134175,0.42870092,0.05995736
"I only had them on 15 minutes before my right ear--the sticky-out one--was hurting. Fortunately I had a sheet of 1/4&#34; stiff plastic packing foam that I'd peeled out of some small shipment, so I cut two donut shapes the same size as the earcups and slid them under the flap of the existing padding. That doubled the padding and is firm enough that it won't compress. Now they're fine on my ears and I should be able to wear them for a few hours at least. I'm only giving them 3 stars because I compared them to my Bose noise-cancelling ones, which I save for when I really need them, and they cut out a lot of high-range treble, including stuff that you really want to make sure is NOT in your mix. So they should work fine, with the caveat that I need to do a final check with the Bose. I wish manufacturers would put in some kind of adjustment for people with wider heads. I will add that the headband is extremely comfortable, much better than the Bose, and that's nice to see in an economy headphone.",1,2,0.020045107,0.225194,0.754761
"I've had numerous earphones over the years, and these Philips earphones sound as good as any I have encountered . . . if, and only if, I can get the earpieces to fit. But they don't. I have tried every single bud included in the package and none of them fit. I even tried mixing them, with one size for one ear and another for the other. I swapped angles, trying to put each bud in at a different angle.Nothing worked.Now, when I pushed each bud into my ear with my finger the sound was extraordinary. But when I realized them, they slipped out of my ear and the sound quality plummeted.It is very possible that the ears of other individuals are constructed very differently than mine. It is possible that I'm part of 1% of the population it won't fit. But maybe I'm part of 25% that can't wear them. These were about the most frustrating earphones I've ever encountered, simply because I can tell that they would produce a tremendous sound if only I could get them to fit my ears.I definitely recommend that you give these a try, especially if you tend to use somewhat smaller sized buds. I usually use the largest buds available, so if you do also, these might not be the best for you. Though to be honest, I find that the angle is as bad as the size of the buds. Perhaps you should try them, but with the expectation that you may need to return them if they don't fit in any way. And they very well may not. But if they do fit, you'll end up with a heck of a great sounding pair of earphones.",1,0,0.9559088,0.03952873,0.004562434

"I purchased two of these units for my five year old twins that had ask Santa for ""real i Pods"".  I read a few reviews, and there weren't any that were truly terrible, so due to the price ($29.99 on sale) I purchased two.  They arrived in the standard plastic clamshell with USB cord for downloading data and charging; as well as a set of standard, though flimsy ear-buds.There were no printed instructions included with the product, just a ""read me"" file.  After a few attempts, my wife was able to transfer music to the device.  The user interface is counter intuitive, this players controls are set up to be used horizontally, and right/left movements make up/down changes onscreen.  The camera function is something that is just passable for a camera.  It entertains children, but an adult would find it hardly passable.  Very low resolution camera that must have a great deal of light for even the most grainy photos.  response to control demands is very slow, and battery life is just a few hours.If you are looking for an MP3 player for a young child, a player that you know probably won't see it's first birthday, this unit was (at $29) priced close to fair.  Not worth a penny more.There is no way that this was ever a $129 player.  Cheap, lightweight and a short term device.",1,2,0.038543798,0.08569261,0.87576365

I couldn't figure out how to make them lie flat like in the picture -- the slot the tie feeds through is at a 90 degree angle to the tie so the tie has to bend around to fit through the slot so the tie ends up being bulky because it doesn't lay flat.

"I've been waiting for a year now for this generation to come out from HP and bought immediately. I'm a software tester by profession, have a couple of pcs (XP and Vista) and a Mac. I was interested in the usual reasons for purchasing the device.Generally as a unified file server I'm satisfied and there are so many glowing comments elsewhere I won't belabor them. Three stars given is three stars earned. I have a coworker without some of the particular hurdles I overcame and he's much more enthusiastic than I.Some gotchas I've run into, for consideration by others:1. If one is a Verizon FIOS home service user, life becomes quite complicated with the device. Do some web searches for FIOS and WHS and you'll see the pain. It's not the WHS's fault - Verizon does not permit a static IP and a server of any kind violates their terms of service. It was easier with their old router apparantly but as a newer subscriber to FIOS, I can say that their newer router is quite difficult - forget the autoconfig. It actually clamps down on most traffic such that one needs to do some port forwarding alchemy to get it to work. In my case, it was not simply forwarding port 80. That was recognized and prohibited. I needed to invoke one of their gaming rules built in to the router software, which did the same forwarding. But since it was their canned version it was allowed. So an addition of the port is required in the URL, rendering the gui pretty useless. I get around it with bookmarks but it defeats the purpose of the family using the photo viewing links. Again not the WHS's fault, but for folks having or considering switching to FIOS (with which I'm otherwise satisfied) it is a consideration.I should note that my previous service, Comcast and router (Linksys WRT300N) didn't present these problems. It's only since I switched to FIOS - and while I have heartfelt differences with their denial of the static IP in their EULA (how come I can game all day long streaming traffic, but accessing a file or photo is forbidden) those are the rules I signed for.2. HP tech support has ranged from really good (call number one ) to usually marginal or abysmal (they've actually put me on hold to look up what the photo viewer was before they could help me). Tip - call during standard business hours only, East Coast time. Don't bother otherwise. When you do call them, the recording says to interrupt it as you navigate through the menu. Don't do it. Wait until it stops 'speaking' and then vocalize your choice.3. The Photo Viewer and Photo Uploader are closely linked. Actually if you check the Help, you'll see that almost all the Photo Viewer pages are actually for the Photo Uploader. It's implied that once one's photos are on the server the Photo Viewer can be used to view them. That's not true - it's actually a link to one's online photos. So for example if you've used the Photo Uploader to put your photos into your Flickr album, then the Photo Viewer can be used to point to them. (Personally I would just 'share' the album from the online site and be done with it). Those that are on your WHS are only viewable through the media browser (music and photo streamer) which has a pretty weak interface for organization and such. I haven't seen that albums are even possible - they may be but I sort of dropped the stick and walked away on that one.4. Mac support works as advertised for samba based file access. But a real caveat is that the Time Machine backups are partial in that one does not have the ability to do a full restore as one does on a PC. Having bought Leopard in part because of the Time Machine utility (which is really great), I suggest a couple of hundred dollars spent on an external hard drive, which will allow a full restore, will be a good investment should it become necessary. It's noted elsewhere but worth repeating that the media aggregator is also pc only. Having my iTunes library hosted on a Mac made a manual file copy necessary, with manual updates subsequently forever.5. Even with the new version, shipping with the 2gb of ram everyone else upgraded the first version to and the faster processor, it's not real fast to interact with. File management is fine but accessing and working with the console is slower than it should be. As essentially an all in one pc with greatly expandable storage, replacing components will be interesting also.6. Add ins. There's a great community of add ins out there. Beware though that I have noted some will not play nicely with this newest generation. Since WHS doesn't support UPS monitoring software (that is to say the use of a UPS is fine, but HP officially does not support any type of software that comes with them to monitor the UPS battery health and do controlled shut downs). I tried an Add In that did, and bricked the unit. Had to do a manual restart and uninstall.",1,2,0.0018665165,0.01839274,0.97974074
"This mouse is touted as FPS mouse for gamers.  I would like to add that it also works great as ergonomic mouse for people who might suffer Carpal Tunnel or Tendonitis on their wrist.Initially, I wasn't too thrilled with the design and the fact that I had to get use to its new grip and button layout.  After about month of daily use I started to notice that my wrist was not hurting or feel tense as much.  I am so glad I decided to take chance and buy this mouse.  It was icing on a cake that at the time I made the buy it was on Xmas sale.I had no issue installing the driver.  I am using mostly default preset.  You can adjust dpi speed easily by clicking one of the button and the color on scroll wheel will change from blue (slow), purple (medium) and orange (fast).  If you don't like the default setting you can easily change the button program to suit your taste by accessing the driver.If your fingers can reach the buttons then chances are this mouse is going to work right for you.UPDATE 01/30/13:I have downgraded my rating from 5-stars to 3-stars for the following reason.1)  The grip cushion came apart.  I was annoyed but it did not effect the usability and performance of the mouse that much.2)  Every once in a while the mouse lock up on my computer forcing me to spend several minutes to try to make it work again.3)  One of the trigger button have started to double-click when I only want single click.  Still can do single-click but have to be very careful.In closing, the mouse still works but it was starting to get annoying to the point that I decided to toss it away...but later retrieved it.  The reason?  Ergonomic.  I tried going back to traditional mouse and noticed that my wrist started to tense up again.  I have decided to use this ergonomic mouse a little more while I place order for new Zalman mouse.UPDATE 02/04/13:Replaced with another Zalman FPS gun mouse.  So far, so good so my original review apply.  I am not going to change my ratings of 3-stars just yet because I am now curious how long thing one will last.

However, the design of the power supply left much to be desired. The brick itself is HUGE, and even more aggravating, is that neither lengths of  the AC cord nor the adapter brick cord (connected to the dock itself) seem to be thought out at all - neither length was long enough to reach my desk from a surge protector directly underneath the cable hole. I had to replace the AC cord and the brick had to be on the table.With something this expensive, you would expect a little bit more thought going into the overall package, and certainly a built-in power adapter would not be out of line.",1,2,0.006589584,0.058072116,0.9353383

"These earbuds have a design that's downright perfect. The body fits into your ear, and the tips go in just right, with minimal pressure required and a good seal.

Frequency response appears to be well-done, with nothing too overemphasized (though I'd like a little less lower-middle), but overall they're somewhat muddy and vague in reproduction.They're being given 3 stars because they do the job I bought them for very well - staying in the ear during workouts.

"I had great hopes for these.  I had previously reviewed and loved the model one down in the line from these,  the Ultimate Ears 700.  I thought that with three drivers these would be better.  In fact, I find them not as good.  As far as sound goes, the bass response is great, deep, clear, detailed.  To my ears, to get this bass response, the midrange is slightly muted so that vocals sound a little 'far away.'  There's a slightly restrained or held back sound where there should be more presence.  High notes seem accurate and detailed.  Overall, I doin't get the clear, precise, articulate sound I did from the 700's.  So I'd definitely save some money and get those from the ULTIMATE EARS line.  If you're looking for excellent sound at about 100 bucks, I'd try the Etonymic Research 6i's.  I like those better than these and they're close to 100 bucks less.Other issues... I found the fit very fussy and in fact could not get them to stay in my ears with any of the included ear tips or the foam ones in the package--I had tio spend another 20 bucks for Comply Foam large ear tips to not have them constantly falling out of my ears at the gym.  180 bucks plus needing to spend another 20 to just get fitting ear tips?

"I had purchased the Amazon Kindle brand case to use with my Fire HD.  I really like the wake-up feature, how the Fire HD fits completely into the case, and the thinness of it.  However, It has just a rubber edging on the opening flap, so it does not stay very stable when standing it up to watch videos.  You cannot easily adjust the angle without it sliding open completely.  Also, the rubber edge easily catches on things and opens while in a tote bag.I thought the Belkin leather standing case would address the issues I had with the Kindle case.  The ""triangle"" type stand that the Belkin case utilizes works perfectly.  I love it.  That is the type of feature I had on my case for my original Kindle Fire and loved it.  Also, I really like the elastic strap on the Belkin case.  This makes it feel very secure when you need to put it in a tote bag or travel bag.While a couple of my issues with the Kindle brand case are addressed perfectly in the Belkin case, the Belkin case does have a very, very major flaw.  The auto wake feature is a must have after being used to it with my other case.  Love it!!!  However, to get this feature to work with the Belkin case, the Fire HD must be installed in the case in a manner so the unit cannot be charged without removing it completely from the case.  This is a terrible flaw!!!  I don't want to remove my Fire  HD every time I want to charge it.  But I also want the wakeup feature to work.  There is no way to have both important options when using the Belkin case.Therefore, I will go back to using my Kindle brand case and deal with the issue of it not standing easily when propped up and with the rubber side catching on items and opening (easily controlled with a rubber band).  However, if you are okay with either the auto wakeup feature not working or with the inability to charge the Fire HD while in the case, then this is a very nice case that is sturdy and good looking.",1,2,0.0036482953,0.020025618,0.97632617

"I purchased this product to upgrade from my regular Logitech MX Duo, because I needed a bluetooth mouse for my laptop, and figured I might as well upgrade my keyboard as well.While the bluetooth duo (referred to as the bt duo form here on) appears to be a good upgrade from the original MX Duo (referred to as the rf duo from here on), there are some drawbacks worth mentioning.The keyboard and mouse of both sets are essentially the same, just with cordless technologies. What is not clear from pictures of the product is that the bluetooth duo uses an entirely different color scheme! The rf duo is black and silver, and in the pictures on this site and logitech's site the bt duo appears exactly the same. This is not the case! The bt keyboard uses a very elegant dark gray/bluish silver scheme similar to that of the dinovo keyboard. The mouse on the other hand, replaces the black and silver of the rf mouse with a cheesy looking dark grey and a more sparkly silver. Obviously this is a matter of personal preference, but I think the new color scheme should be noted and made more obvious on the logitech site and store sites. I wish I had known about this color difference when I purchased it, because it doesn't quite match my black tower and monitor.In addition to this, the new materials in the bt mouse are inferior to those of the rf mouse. The solid feeling, smooth black rubber on the rf duo mouse has been replaced by a rougher, harder feeling substance which doesn't feel very pleasant. The side back and forward buttons don't feel as solid as those on the rf mouse. Overall the bt mouse feels much more like a toy.The hub for the bluetooth duo is about the same in appearance as that of the rf duo. It is much more powerful however. It is an actual bluetooth hub, and you can connect any bluetooth device to it. One minor gripe for me is that the connect button is lit in this set, with a blue led which looks cool in the daytime. I sleep in the same room as my computer however, and this little light being on at night is going to annoy me.The most obvious advantage of the bt duo over the rf duo is range. My rf duo could get maybe 6 feet from the computer on a good day. The bluetooth duo has a range of about 5 times the rf duo, and works through walls.This extended range is not at a price, however. The bt keyboard requires 4 batteries, instead of the original 2 of the rf keyboard. It has been said by other reviewers that battery life is much shorter on the bt keyboard also. I would imagine the more powerful bt radio would cause a significant decrease in battery life. My old rf keyboard went for months on end without replacement batteries. Hopefully the bt keyboard won't bankrupt me from new batteries.For the mouse this is not as much of an issue due to the charging station, but I will still be bringing extra batteries when I use the mouse with my laptop.Software wise, I had no problems with the set up and installation of the bt duo. It is a very good, albeit memory hungry software set. The rf duo software used less memory, but this is not as much of an issue to me as it would be to some.Overall, this is a fine product, but if you don't need the range or versatility provided by bluetooth, I would stick with the tried and true (and cheaper) rf duo.",1,2,0.17923729,0.373986,0.44677672
Possibly overly complex.  There is a switch for each output port.  I have to see if I was overloading the power the ports (with the AC adapter) was able to provide.

"Pros:The backpack looks great. Workmanship is very good. The qualities of materials used, including the zippers, straps, etc. are all very good. It is comfortable to carry around on your back.Cons:The top compartment is meant to hold a DSLR as indicated in the picture, but it can barely fit a DSLR body with a short prime lens. Since I use my 18-200 zoom almost exclusively, I would have to detach the 3.5"" long zoom and store it in the lower compartment, while storing only the body in the top one. This is not convenient. Also, the lower compartment is configured to hold 4 lenses, and is not designed to be reconfigurable. You can force it, but it wouldn't look good. The laptop compartment is another weak area. There is some padding, but I would like more. There is no designed space for laptop power adapter, USB cables, external hard disks, mouse, CD-ROM, etc.Conclusion:It's a great looking, high quality backpack for one SLR body, 4 lenses, a notebook computer, and some general space for everything else you wish to carry.

"The design of this Sony is very sleek and stylish.  The FM tuner works great and is a nice feature to have.  Once you get the music on the player it works very well and has a long battery life.  Therein lies the problem.  You can only use the proprietary Sony software to load the music, so if you are already used to using windows media player or Real Networks player you are out of luck.  The Sony player isn't too bad per se, but it's something new you must learn how to use and the interface is a little clunky. I set this up for my father-in-law and there is no way he is going to be able to load songs himself.  I just wish all of these different companies would allow you to transfer music files using any of the available software.

The USB feature is great, I love that.I do have one serious concern, and that's the sound. I will say, on a scale of 1 to 10, and 10 being the best audio, this camera records probably at a 2, and that's being generous. What the heck, Sony?

"I think there are better options in the $80 (or less) price range, but this was a decent headset. The sound is pretty good and I think that is the best I can say for this product. Otherwise, it didn't fit very well in my ears and the feel itself isn't very solid. It is nice to have the volume controls right on the wire and the nice thing is that those are not very bulky (as I've seen on other sets). You barely notice it is there when you are using them. When using this to talk over the phone the people could tell I was on a remote speaker but they could still understand me. Again, about status quo for headphones like these... I haven't found a set yet where people didn't comment on the sound quality being a bit more poor than talking right into the phone mic.

Picked up the Bond 50 boxed set for a great price but I had no idea where to put the gargantuan boxed set. These cases turned out to be a huge space saver.

"I bought two of these in February. I had been using a 3' model made by another manufacturer, and wanted a little more max cable length. For a few months all was well. It's tricky to get the cable to retract all the way, the housing is a bit too snug to fit all the wound cable. So there's that. Then sometime in May the plastic housing supporting the micro USB connector cracked and fell off one of the two I'd bought. I wound some dental floss around it to reinforce it, and it has stayed fixed. Hey, stuff happens. But a couple of days ago the second one I bought had the exact same problem. Clearly a flaw in the design, especially in light of the fact that these cables don't get a ton of use and are not used roughly at all. Both mine are still usable, but the floss looks silly, and I shouldn't have needed to repair them both in just a few months.",1,0,0.9523161,0.04188451,0.005799318
"This Ipad cover by Belkin certainly protects your Ipad with minimum bulk and from what I can tell, enables not only protection, but two positions for pedestal functionality, with a nice magnetic foldover closure.  My IPad 3 secures perfectly into the corner enclosures without the risk of falling out and the material, waterproof canvas, vinyl, and velour, looks nice.  The inside contains a velvety soft velour material, but if you're using this as a pedestal for viewing movies, it will pick up every fiber or pet hair along the way.The most awkward thing about the case is the multiple spines to configure different propping positions.  Since I tend to use the ipad more like an actual paper notebook, ie flipping open at the middle, it doesn't actually work this way unless I have the Ipad lying flat on a surface.  There's a spine on the front and a spine on the back, so if you simply try to flip it open, it feels like I'm tearing the whole cover off. This takes some getting used to.  Other than that, I may have missed the setup, but the alleged AutoWake Magnets that are supposed to turn on the Ipad when I flip open the cover do not seem to work.  Again, this could be user error on my part since I didn't change any settings, but I suppose the instructions could have been a little more clear, otherwise, it's just not working.  Other than that, all the cutouts for chargers, headphones and camera are perfectly positioned for easy access and usage, but there's no designated place to attach a stylus if you're prone to use one.  It's a nice case, but definitely more practical for propping up presentations or movies.",1,2,0.007806847,0.08172154,0.9104717
"First digital.  Good pictures - when you have the time to wait for the camera to power up and don't mind a considerable shutter lag time - no real problem with the pictures, BUT the start up time and shutter lag time were/are incredibly frustrating.  I went back to a film camera because of those two problems - when taking ""grab shots"" - and for the complete control I get with a 35mm SLR when taking ""serious photography"" shots.  For a point and shoot, quick ""grab the shot"" camera it just doesn't get it.  On it's behalf, it is one of the earlier point and shoot digitals.  They have come a long way since this one.  Get a newer model and some of the problems have been cured.  After about a three year lay off (of digital cameras), I just got back into the digital point and shoot cameras with a Canon A620.  It is far superior to the 775.  This camera just can't keep up with the grandkids - or any other ""quick shoot"" situation.

"I admit, the reviews I've read about this thing were pretty great for the most part, so I was willing to spend the extra money to get something I knew was highly rated... but I have to admit, I'm not all that impressed.Firstly, the sound is great -- if you're sitting still.  I'm a runner.  And after reading reviews about how this holds into place and doesn't budge during a good jog, I felt this was going to be ideal for my needs.  Well... this things doesn't exactly hold into place like you may think.  It comes with 3 different attachments for both the in-ear piece, as well as the hook piece that holds onto your ear so it doesn't fall out.  After several attempts with different size combinations, I found what seemed to best match my ear size and shape.  I went for a run and within the first 15-minutes I'm already starting to fiddle with the thing.  It was pushed snugly into place (that is required to get the full bass and sound from the speakers, otherwise you lose all audio quality -- even if it's barely coming out) and during my first 15-minutes it started to slide out, thus causing my audio to lose strength.  So... as we who run have all had to do, I push it back in.  Now, mind you... the little hook piece that's tucked into my external ear folds is still where it's supposed to be, but somehow that has nothing to do with the inner ear bud that's pushed down into my inner ear.  So... don't be fooled thinking that they are somewhat connected.So... this little scenario goes on for the next 30-minutes (during my 45-minute jog).  Every 15-30 seconds or so I'm pushing it back into my ear.  On both sides, after the first 15-minute looseness.Also, there is a way to make the cable shorter by these little black plastic pieces.  You're supposed to somehow overlap them back and forth through the grooves of the plastic pieces... but let me just say, that was a ridiculous mess.  I finally figured it out, with very little help coming from the instruction booklet.  Also, once you loop the cable -- be prepared for it to stay that way forever until you pull the cable completely back off of them, because those little suckers don't allow any room to increase or decrease your slack.  I fought for a while with all of the pieces of this device -- the cable shorteners, the inner ear buds, the external ear clips -- and have to say it was NO where near worth the sound coming from it.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because, 1 - yes, the sound was actually very good when properly inserted, 2 - the lightness of the headphones is far superior to other such devices, 3 - connects up without any problems and also has the control switch on the headphones, and 4 - battery life is excellent.The reasons I disliked it are written above, but to recap, this device is complicated with assembly (inner ear buds, not so much). If you're a runner, get ready for constant readjustment (one of the most annoying things to a runner). And frankly, over-priced for such flaws.",1,1,0.057719283,0.79700434,0.14527632
"The main problem is that this item caused an unnecessary trip to the car dealer for vehicle repair. As it turns out, the camera emits enough stray RF that it can cause tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) failure messages in newer cars. Through the same stray RF, it can also significantly reduce the range of key fobs. An online search will show others with similar issues. Unplugging the unit fixed the car. ugh.Ok--putting that aside, the camera is rather large, and the suction cup mount is just as big. It needs to be mounted high for unobstructed view. It takes a lot of windshield real-estate, so it really needs to be mounted behind the rearview mirror (which is where some cars hide their TPMS/key fob receivers).The cord is significantly long enough to route around the perimeter of the windshield. The camera has menus is English which are easy enough to understand and navigate. Video quality is very good, and the lens provides adequate coverage to the sides. The pull-down color viewfinder is nice for assuring alignment, but is too small for readable text while moving (ok for setup though).Overall ok for the price.",1,0,0.820606,0.15923667,0.02015727

It is simple to use and offers advanced features.  It also allows very simple conversion to infrared.  It does things that no general ""consumer"" dslr can do.  If you are looking for a point and shoot dslr I recommend the evolt line from Olympus.  If you want to take photographs that take your breath away then this is your camera.  This camera gives you the ability to be a photographic artist rather than just a picture taker.  If you read the ""professional"" reviews for the sd14 they will rate the camera according to start speed, ergonomics, etc.  They all miss the beauty of the sd14.  It's not about the insignificant details, it's about the photographs.  Hands down this camera will beat any other camera in the 14mp class.  Yes it is 14mp.

"Having had my good earphones fizzle out last year, the ones I've been using have been less than stellar, so I was psyched to get the opportunity to try these out. Not only are they nicer looking, but they're specially made for women too, and since my ears are on the smaller side, I figured these were practically tailor-made for me. Sadly, they turned out less than ideal.Pros:- Attractive design and colors (mine are the blue, which looks great with the silver and white). What can I say, I'm superficial like that.- Three sizes of clear(-ish) silicone ear-tips (great for mixing and matching if you're a freak like me with two different sized ear canals ;P)- Noise-reducing to help block out bothersome intrusions.- The silicone doesn't bother my ears. Other silicone ear-tips I've used in the past have made my canals itchy so these were a pleasant surprise.Cons:- Disappointing sound quality. Too bass-y for my liking and one earbud is louder than the other, so it makes me feel a little of kilter.- Not great for any big activity. These do all right while walking, but any more than power walking and there are muffled noises from the cord clunking against me.- Earbuds slip out of my ears a bit too easily. I've tried interchanging the ear-tips to see if it's a size issue, but that hasn't fixed the problem, so I think it might be the silicone.On the whole, I'd say these are pretty average; I've used better and I've used worse. For twenty bucks, I'd say they're a bit overpriced, but drop that to fifteen or less, and I'd say go for it.

"I've actually lived with both TheBoom v4 and the Plantronics MX500 headsets for a fair amount of time. Here's the apples-to-apples comparison:Comfort: Plantronics winsTheBoom uses a soft rubber ear bud that goes into the outer ear canal, plus a coated moldable ""wire"" you shape to fit around the top/back of your ear. While the earbud portion is comfortable, the moldable wire becomes very uncomfortable after about 30-45 minutes, and downright painful after one hour. The Plantronics uses a hard egg-shaped ear canal insert that could be more comfortable, although after a minute or so, you pretty much forget  it's in there. The soft rubber under/behind-ear harness is quite comfy.Weight: Plantronics winsTheBoom tends to slip out of position fairly often due to its shape and weight (the ""sweet spot"" as others have called it, is the limited area that your voice will register with the headset, as opposed to being filtered out as ambient sound). The Plantronics, due to a much shorter boom, does not.Inbound sound quality: Even raceIn both cases, you can hear your caller quite easily. Both include an inline control capsule that offers volume up/down/mute, although TheBoom requires you to hold the mute button, unlike the Plantronics unit, where you just toggle the mute off/on, then let go.Outbound sound quality: It depends....Initially, TheBoom seemed to be a great option for me, since during the summer I literally take my office out to the back deck (people used to complain about hearing birds in the background...they'd really be jealous if they realized I was holding conference calls in a bathing suit). Wind wasn't an issue, so no opinion there, but...as time progressed, I began hearing complaints about static, which I attribute to the fact TheBoom cord requires two parts--one that runs from the headset to a connector, and a second that adapts the connector to my cordless office phone's headset jack. Additionally, I often hear complaints that people can't hear me--if TheBoom slips even one iota out of the ""sweet spot,"" your voice is filtered out as ambient noise. Pretty tough to keep the mic exactly where it needs to be, not move around, and pray you've conquered the static and loss of volume. For that reason, I've gone back to the Plantronics unit, which sounds just as good, with greater consistency/reliability. Just means no more conference calls on the deck. (bummer)Construction quality: Plantronics wins (hands down)In under one year, I had to replace the sponge portion on TheBoom's microphone, and am now replacing the soft rubber portion of the ear bud. Given the repeated complaints about static, I must also be sure the connection between the two parts of TheBoom cord is on a solid surface with no one as much as breathing in its direction. The Plantronics has never needed replacement or repair. Its shorter, single cord is ample for reaching between the headset and phone, and allows me to easily jack out if I need to leave the phone behind for a moment, with no major jack in production to get things lined up perfectly again (as is always the case with TheBoom).Cost: Plantronics by farTheBoom is an investment that I've come to regret. The Plantronics unit, on the other hand, could be replaced several times over, if needed (although it's given no indication it's needed any time soon).So what if I have to step indoors for conference calls from now on? Plantronics allows me to function easily the remaining 90% of the time, which is more valuable to me than the birds. Plantronics wins.",1,2,0.073364824,0.3511632,0.575472

"Like most people I hate having seven remotes to control my system so combining them into one unit is a great idea. I appreciate the opportunity to review the Ultimate One and compare it to my two-year-old One with the failing buttons. Although the Ultimate One is pretty smart and quite functional in many ways, Logitech misses the mark for me on several important points.Software: Try finding Roku for the Harmony. There are several classifications to look under but none of them make sense for Roku. It's listed under &#34;DVD.&#34; Go figure. Try Apple TV. Good luck with that one. Brand new hardware (Ultimate One) with the same old crappy software. If they spent a couple of days with a new software team leader in charge, maybe they'd come up with a better system, but this one has irritated me since I bought the old One more than two years ago.Hardware: Improved the shape and size over the old One so that now it stands up in the charging stand, taking up much less room on the table where it sits. Also added a textured back to make it easier to grip. They got rid of the superfluous buttons that cluttered up the old One, but also removed some pretty useful ones. These buttons are now accessed through layers of a touch screen. Sometimes this works out well, and sometimes not. Really depends on your equipment and the type of controlling you need to do. For me, I still keep the original remotes close enough that I can use them to do the more intricate things I don't want to bother setting up and troubleshooting on the Harmony. Yes, troubleshoot. Not everything works right the first time.Some inconveniences: Ever hand your remote to someone so they can control things? Well, be careful with the Ultimate. About 1/4 times one of us will accidentally activate something on the touchscreen during transfer from one hand to the other, and we're being careful. Also, for some reason they put the playback buttons (play, FF, REW, etc) above the touchscreen. Try using those without activating something on the touchscreen!Set up: Since I already had a Harmony One that was fine-tuned to my system (which took months to finesse!!!), set up was just a matter of transferring the information from the One to the Ultimate. Easy-cheesy. I don't look forward to learning how to set up the Ultimate for a new piece of equipment after seeing that the software is still the same: lame. For now, the Ultimate controls most things fine with no fuss on my part.If you want to get rid of all of your remotes the Ultimate One could be your solution. For me it wasn't. If you want the convenience of controlling most of the common functions of a lot of equipment and don't mind the limitations, then this expensive remote could be a great addition to your collection. We now have nine remotes instead of the seven that came with the equipment. The old One is still on the charger for my wife's use (she doesn't care for the lack of buttons on the Ultimate). The Ultimate is for me, most of the time. The individual equipment remotes are stashed close-by in case I need to access something I can't find on the Ultimate.If Logitech would update their software to the 21st century (they still have Laserdisc but don't have a proper category for ROKU) and put the touch screen at the top with all of the buttons grouped together, I'd love the Ultimate One. If they don't make changes to the software I won't buy a new One when this One wears out.",1,1,0.24249728,0.6529403,0.10456245

"I could not get my TIVO to use this drive.  There were two symptoms.  Sometimes it would say external storage was detected, and asked if I wanted to use it or ignore it.  I told it to use it.  The TIVO would restart, and say the same thing (external storage detected, do I want to use it?), even after 4 or 5 tries.  The other thing I saw (less often) was not detecting the drive at all.I called TIVO support but they couldn't help.  I was going to return the drive, but some of the reviews here mentioned that the eSATA cable (which is included) might be bad.  So I bought one at the local Best Buy for $20, and it worked perfectly the first time and since (although it's only been a few days).  There are several versions of this cable from Amazon for only a few bucks, but I wasn't sure this was the problem (didn't want to have to return two things).

"It was wrong to have ordered this keyboard.It is very well made.  It works perfectly with my Kindle Fire HD.  The battery takes a long lasting charge.  The keys feel good and the text  does register correctly - and it even has some keyboard short-cuts..  Also, I think it's pretty.However, I don't think it improves my typing speed.  It is small to conform to the size of the Tablet and is easily portable, but that makes it just too small for touch typing.  Hunt and peck takes me as much time on the Belkin as it takes on the screen keyboard.  Finally, because the screen keyboard in the Tablet is so good, I probably won't bother carrying the Belkin keyboard with me.This means that, for me, it just would not be worth the retail price.  But that is me.  The Belkin keyboard is a high quality product.  I expect to be criticized for giving it only 3-STARS.  And yes, you may love it.",1,2,0.00079056213,0.0061597205,0.99304974
"I am by no means a very technical person. So I won't try to explain things I'm not qualified to do. What I can do is give you my experience withAmazonBasics 8.5GB 8x DVD+R DL.I tested these out for three different uses. My daughter had a Power Point presentation she needed to take to school and although she usually uses a flash drive, we decided to use a disk this time. The second was for a CD of new Grandbaby pictures that we wanted to share via ""snail mail"" and the third for actual DVD movies.With the Power Point it took approximately 9 minutes to transfer over her presentation and the playback was as good as the original, no skips or errors.  For the CD of pictures we had approximately 7.5GB of pictures and on the first (and second) attempt I received a media error. Not sure what to do, I actually came back to the reviews here on Amazon and saw others with this experience and their solutions. For me to fix it I had to lower the write speed to 4x and then it worked just fine. On to the last test with DVD's; I do not have the software capable of doing this, but my sister does so to her house we went! Years ago we had several reel to reels of family movies transferred to disk and so I decided I wanted to make some additional copies of those.  Because of the problems with the speed on the picture writing we lowered it to 4x at the start and we were easily able to fit 4 the hours of video on each of the four disks we did. At the speed we used it did take about 22 minutes each, but I was enjoying the visit with my sister so I didn't mind.  As for the quality, I can't tell the difference between the original and the copes and I'm very pleased with that.So far from my experiences with two different Amazon Basics products, I like what I see.",1,2,0.0036290612,0.0075717135,0.98879915

"I've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I've used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)I believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.What do you REALLY get for a ""high end"" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don't know.  I purchased one (which was ""top of the line"") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!What does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:---""THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.""---A digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).Overall, I'm very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)(P.S. for first time users, don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you'll never need them again.)",2,2,0.0007163354,0.0014648814,0.9978188

"Since I bought my Canon DSLRs (50D, then traded for a 7D) I've tried a number of Canon consumer and ""prosumer"" zoom lenses:- EF-S 55-250 - OK kit lens, but unhappy with the plastic build quality and IQ (image quality)- EF 70-300 IS - better than the above, but not very sharp at 300mm- EF 70-200 F4L - wonderful lens, but I found myself wishing for more reach(I never really considered the excellent EF 70-200 F2.8L due to its size, weight, and price.)I eventually settled for the 70-200 F4L with a Kenko 1.4x teleconverter - but found for what I was shooting (motorsports) I was always at the long end of the zoom range.  This is when I decided to get the 70-300 F4-5.6L.The 70-300L has been a fantastic purchase.  It is much sharper than the non-L 70-300 at the long end, and a bit sharper than the 70-200L / 1.4x combo.  It is wonderful to be able to shoot at 300mm wide open and not worry about whether the resulting images will be sharp and contrasty or not.  In addition, it is actually shorter and IMHO a bit less obtrusive than the 70-200 F4L.  (It is certainly easier to fit in my camera bag than the 70-200 F4L.)  My only complaint is that Canon really should have supplied a tripod mount with the lens, or at least provided the accessoryCanon Tripod Mount Ring C (WII)at a reasonable price.In the end I could only keep one of these lenses, and it was the 70-300L.  And while I don't regret that decision one bit, theCanon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS USM Lenshas its own advantages: it's lighter, has a constant F4 aperture, and is a bit less expensive.

"When I first got this Turtle Shell, my electronically addicted children turned up their noses at it.  They thought it was stupid and did not really do much for them.  Then I turned it on with my Sansa MP3 player and they perked up and I got their attention.  I plugged it in with the jack (included) and the sound from this little gem was amazing.My son grabbed his Nokia C3 and plugged it in with the auxiliary cable and the sound was unreal!  The family fought over who would use it next and tried every kind of music from classical to hip hop, rock, jazz, Christmas, and intense vocals.  In every case the Turtle Shell performed really surprisingly well.  I could not get anything bluetooth to hook up with it at the time of this review, but as I work with it, I will update this review.The highs and lows are excellent and the sound produced is well rounded and quite intense.  The dynamic range of sound is really good and it has fantastic mids with the perfect touch of lows so that the sound is balanced.  The design is very easy to use, carry, set up, and use whether staying put, or carrying with you.  The design of the Turtle Shell sends the sound in multiple directions that covers a wide range of area.  You can either aim it on its side or have it sitting up to cover about 120 degree of sound direction.The cover of the jack and recharge spots is a bit difficult to get into place sometimes, but it is doable.  A small frustration with an otherwise fabulous speaker.  If you don't use the blue tooth, it will shut the blinking light off so that it won't use battery power.  It is light and is very solidly built.  The volume buttons are a bit difficult to press and that is a bit frustrating.  They seem a bit stiff and not easy to control.

On the down side is that it is really heavy.  When you put on the proper ball head it weight about 6 - 7 lbs.  Lot to tote around all day long.,2,2,0.0019860861,0.020649046,0.97736496

"Found this based on the LifeHacker custom build recommendation.  Its a nice case with only a few drawbacks.  My two biggest complaints are the bright, flashing LED lights on the front of the case that are always on when the PC is on.  I'm considering placing some tape over them as one of them stays on even when the PC is sleeping.Otherwise, it works great, and there is still room for an 80mm fan after all additional recommended parts are installed.

"This is out first projector and frankly had no idea about what to look for in a projector.  Came across this on Amazon and it had amazing reviews, so just decided to give it a try.  Its been over a month now and we are very happy with the picture quality. We have already gotten several compliments about the picture quality!  Initially, we just watched it on the basement concrete wall for a few days and with enough distance from the wall the picture quality was great! However, when we got our Silver Ticket 120&#34; projector screen (also from Amazon) and installed it the picture went from being great to unbelievable! We couldn't be happier with our purchase.We have now mounted the projector on the basement ceiling and setup was a snap. We have not played with settings yet and are still using the default ones as we are happy with the picture quality. The built in speaker is not bad, but we bought a Vizio soundbar and the audio is much better now. Hope the lamp lasts as long as they claim it to last!

It's a pleasant responsive light happy tap.Easy to use or set up.Since the price tag for this isn't precisely cheap, I would recommend visiting keyboards in an actual brick-and-mortar store (one that lets you actual touch the merchandise and not just look at it through a plexiglass box) or test-driving a friend's to see which feels most friendly to YOUR little fingers.

"I got this after selling my couple year old PDA gpa that I never used. That thing had the annoying feature of every time the battery died, it unloaded ALL The maps you had loaded in thru the computer. completely beyond aggravation and didn't want to deal with it.I had tried other garmin nuvis and found them easy to use and what I had expected from a GPS.I had the option to get it built in to my newer car, but with the rate of people breaking in and ripping them out of the dash, I felt more comfortable with a removeable one that I can also bring on journeys in other peoples cars.(or lend it to a person who has no idea where they're going).I absolutely love that while you're out you can find the nearest target, sephora, grocery store. You can just look up a store by alphabetical order and most likely it'll have one in the system that will work for you. The text-to-speech was as expected and something specific I was looking for was that it said the actual street, not just ""turn left if 50 feet"". Now it says ""turn left in 50 feet on Main Street"". The only things I would change is certain things in needs to be more specific about. I sometimes find myself responding to it being like ""well, it would have been nice if you had mentioned..."" and right now I cant think of a specific incident, only that sometimes I could have used more of a ""coming up, look, it's coming up!!"" warning or detailed instruction. But heck, it's a machine that gives you directions, so it's pretty great. I also chose this model for the bluetooth feature. I'd never used it before on anything else, but I find it super that when my cell rings, the GPS rings. I don't have to fumble for my phone, I just hit ""answer"" or ""ignore"" on the GPS. People say it sounds like I'm in a tunnel when talking to them and that theres a bit of an echo, but for just quick hi, bye kinda things and no long conversations, its perfect. You shouldnt be talking while driving whether it's hands free or not.I will also note that if you have an AUX jack on your radio(which I use for my IPOD) if you're really nervous about not knowing where you're going,you can plug it into the GPS and the sound comes thru your speakers, so you can control the loudness if you're really just like ""I have no clue where I'm going, I want to concentrate on where I'm going and nothing else. GPS, speak to me"". You obviously cant listen to the radio when it's like this, so it doesnt interject thru the radio or anything, its just silence when the gps is not speaking.(if you want it to interject, I think thats a feature on the more expensive models that it goes thru your speakers all the time).I think it has anything you could really need for mild-to-moderate use, not exactly sure what the more expensive models hold, but this one seems to cover a bit of everything without paying an extremely expensive price.Great little GPS, I'd definitely buy it again.",2,2,0.00089300756,0.0014308103,0.9976762

"I got this from BH Photo for five hundred dollars after the mail in rebate.  I research long and hard and I think this gets you the best bang for your money at this price.  Note that this used to be sold at a grand last year with all the specs included.  Finding a similar spec laptop nowadaws will be very hard...but let me know if you find one.Here's what I like about this laptop:1. It has discrete nvdia GPU card which switches automatically between Intel integrated graphics when not needed.  There is no flickering when it switches, you won't notice it's there.  A standalone GPU will always be better than integrated GPU which robs some of your RAM.2. It has WiDi, USB 3.0, camera, hdmi, vga port, and bluetooth. This is hard to find at this level.3. Quick access to internet.  Even when the laptop is off, there is a button to quickly get you to internet in seconds without having to power on your laptop.  Pretty neat feature.4. Of course the casing, it has wood and aluminum finish...NOT plastic unlike acer or gateway at this price.  No flex anywhere.5. The warranty - 1 year accidental warranty and 2 year manufacturer warranty.My only comment would be that it gets hot under where the fan is situated but the keyboard and touchpad remains cool so don't place it directly on your lap.This is not a 2nd generation Intel BUT for sure you will be happy owning this.

It slips right onto her Kindle Keyboard so naturally that she even keeps it attached when she doesn't need to turn on the light.  She has had it for a week or so and has not had to replace the batteries, so I don't yet know how long they will last.  A suggestion would be to add a micro usb connector to allow running it from an external power source when available.  The little gooseneck really makes it possible to position the light for even lighting, but when it first arrived, it was tricky to get it right at first.  I found that twisting the part that holds the leds counterclockwise a full turn made this easier.

"These speakers were a great addition to my home office. I use them every day. My HP laptop has some low-quality speakers, and they sound like mono, not stereo. So, I purchased a pair of these on eBay, and they work flawlessly.Somehow (beyond my knowledge), the speakers seem to interfere with my Cobra MicroTalk 2-Way Radios. It seems a little odd, seeing as how they are not wireless speakers, but I am not frustrated by this. I'm able to get around this bump in the road.If you're like me, and you want to know more about this product than just what the description tells you, here are some details:+ When you turn them on, a short, medium-high-pitched ""beep"" sounds.+ The power button is also the volume adjustment.There is a headphone jack on the left speaker, so you can easily plug in headphones without having to unplug your speakers. This comes in handy for a tower computer.+ The USB cable on the speakers is just to power them. If you have an iPhone charger, you can just plug the cable into that and plug the brick from the charger into the wall or a power strip.+ The 3.5mm jack is for sound. That's what you plug into your computer.+ They work for both Mac and Windows.+ A blue light emits when they are turned on.+ They are not battery-powered. You cannot charge them.Overall, no problems so far. I've owned these for about 3-4 days, but I don't expect they will give me any trouble.

"After waiting just over a month to get this TV, all I can say is it was definetly worth the wait.  Part of the reason it took so long I believe is the timing of the order. I ordered it on December 15, right before the holidays, so maybe that slowed it down some, but regardless of the time it took, the TV really is amazing.I did about 3 months research by reading all the reviews on Amazon as well as other websites. By the way thanks for the first 15 or so reviews I read on here before purchasing this TV, it was a really big help in making my decision. I wanted an LCD because the plasmas have such a glare, among other issues. I had it finally narrowed down to the Sony and the Samsung LN-S4695d. I didn't like the look of the Sammy's shiny black frame, although the picture quality is right up there with the Sony. What finally made my decision was seeing the Sony at BJ's on display. It just blew me away, and my wife was also startled at the picture quality of the Sony. Also the fact that the Sony was only about $200 more than the Sammy helped the decision. By the way BJ's price is over $700 more than Amazons price if you figure in the extra $200 sales tax that you would have to pay.I have the TV hooked to Comcast Digital cable through the HDMI input. I also bought the Sony upconverting DVD player which is run through the other HDMI input on the TV. The DVD's really do look better with the upconverting player which converts the DVD's to a 1080i signal. Although the picture that really grabs me is the HD channels on the cable. I watched the playoffs of the NFL last week and was absolutely wowed at the detail. The Discovery HD channel is also amazing. I can't imagine a TV that could get even a better picture. I haven't seen this TV's picture quality with a direct 1080p signal such as the Blue-Ray disc or the HD DVD, but I can't imagine how it can be better that the high def channels in 1080i. I'm just glad that I have the 1080p technology on this TV for the future when hopefully someday soon all DVD formats and brodcast formats will be in 1080p. If anyone that bought this Sony has used it watching a Blue Ray disc, please comment.It's been over two weeks now that I received this TV and the WOW factor is kinda wearing off, but when I go into the bedroom to watch my ""old fashioned"" 480i TV, before sleeping, the picture looks super blurry and I can't imagine I watched TV like that for the past 49 years. Also I don't have the clouding issues as others talked about. So in wrapping this up, if you are looking for a top notch high def TV, I seriously think that the Sony KDL-46V2500 is the abslute best out there on the market today for the price. The experience of buying this through Amazon was also great. I would give Amazon and Eagle Freight who delivered the TV both 5 stars as well as 5 stars for the TV. Also I have to mention that purchasing this TV through another website besides Amazon......BEWARE, I 've read horror stories about other companies that may offer this TV for a hundred or two hundred dollars cheaper. The fact that Amazon backs up all their stuff for 30 days made me feel confident with dealing with them.",2,2,0.0011093396,0.0026867215,0.99620396

"My ancient Canon SD1000 is the best ""tiny"" digital camera that I have used.  I bought the SD940 to get its wider 28mm zoom.  When there are eight people around a birthday cake, 28mm is more useful than 35mm.I was very unhappy with the quality of photos from the SD940.  Flash photos had what looked like tiny bubbles in most photos.  Outdoor photos were almost always in soft focus and even-toned subjects, such as the sky, had two tiny dark circles visible in every photo.Finally, I sent the SD940 back to Canon.  Just eight days later, Canon delivered it back to me with a new lens assembly.  The SD940 can now match the high quality of my SD1000. I use the ""Program Mode"", and lock the ISO at ISO 100. I set exposure at minus 1/3 stop for more saturated colors.  I use ""My Colors"" to boost sharpness, and reduce contrast.  These settings produce photos that are excellent, but which can often by improved by using ""i-contrast"" during playback to brighten shadow areas.So, with its new lens assembly and with my taking control of focus, ISO, and exposure in the program mode, I am getting excellent photos.  However, people who use the SD940 in auto mode are likely to be unhappy with many of their photos as photos at ISO 400 and ISO 800 are sub-par.Thumbs down to Canon for selling a camera with a defective lens assembly.  Thumbs up to Canon for fixing my camera and returning it to me in just eight days, free of charge.The SD940 uses the same battery as my older SD1000.  I can bring both cameras on a trip and they can share a charger and backup batteries.  The charger is only slightly bigger than the battery, so it is easy to bring on trips.

"I have to agree with the positive reviews here. I waited about a month before reviewing and here are my impressions. Ever since plugging in the card, turning on my Nook Color and selecting the new operating system option, I have yet to use the Nook Color OS. I'm amazed at how quickly everything runs from a micro SD card. This has really unlocked a lot of capabilities. Just for fun I tested Netflix and lots of other apps and all have worked well. I'm disappointed the Android app stores don't seem to differentiate between tablet apps and smartphone apps but that's not a fault of the device. These app stores seem immature compared with Apple's but I was able to find the apps I wanted pretty easily. Once I was done playing, I began using the tablet as I imagined I would - to read not only Nook books but also Amazon Kindle and other e-bookstore varieties. I was surprised to learn that the Nook app for Android actually has more features than the Nook OS reader. Why would they do that?So I have everything I had before (all of my books and magazines downloaded easily) PLUS all of my Kindle books (I prefer the Kindle reader).

"I've purchased dozens of earphones and earbuds for under $100 over the years.  (I reserve the big bucks for speakers and electronics.)  Starting with Koss and Superex headphones, I've ended up happy with Grado's.  But up until recently it's been harder to find earbuds that are wearable, great-sounding, AND that I could afford to lose at the gym or on vacation.  So my wife and I have been using some version of Sony's MDR-EX series for years now, and been satisfied with them.  But with quality earbuds finally catching on, there are a lot more brands and models to choose from.  So with the destruction of my last set of earbuds and the arrival of the value-priced Shure SE215, it was time to give Shure a try.Thankfully, there were no nasty surprises.  In fact, I think the reviews are pretty accurate overall.  Thankfully I've had no problem with intermittent connections at the earpiece as reported by a couple of reviewers.The SE215 earbuds are quality made, and appear quite rugged.  Hopefully they'll last for many years, at least as long as the much cheaper Sony's have.  The selection of rubber and foam earpiece ""sleeves"" provide a good range of fit to choose from.  I expected to prefer the foam, which does fit easily and snugly, with excellent sound isolation.  But perhaps a little too snugly for me, resulting in long term fit-fatigue.  I'm trying out the standard rubber sleeves now; so far so good.The way these fit over and in the ears is unusual, but very effective.  They retain their place AND seal even when moving around or exercising. They take 2-3 times longer to insert in your ears than standard earbuds, so don't purchase these if you have to remove your earbuds often for any reason. Since the cable goes over the ear, cable noise is very low, but not completely gone.Sound quality is very important to me.  I want the best of both worlds; realistic, natural sound AND knock-my-socks-off ""great-sounding"" performance. Usually you can't have both in one product, especially transducers. What the SE215's provide is more of the former; a mostly flat response with no people-pleasing-peaks. As a result, your emotional and/or intellectual involvement will be wholly dependent on the music and production values.  This is as it should be anyway.As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no lack of bass. It is quite solid, with plenty of kick when called for, but without bloat. I wouldn't recommend them as ""bass-lover"" models; they just aren't bass-shy. Male vocals can be a little warm, but not unpleasantly so.  Mid-range is natural and clear, just like I want it.Due to a slight hearing loss I am not a great judge of high-frequencies. But to me these sound a little rolled-off in the region I CAN hear. This was easily corrected by a slight amount of EQ above 6KHz. (It may also be that I've become accustomed to earbuds with too much high end!)I am especially gratified to know that an American company like Shure has survived from 1925 well into the digital age. Shure is still making fine products at reasonable prices. There is just no way to avoid those analog transducers, right?",2,2,0.048384357,0.052072678,0.899543

"My parents have been looking to replace their 20 year old big screen television for awhile now and took advantage of my being around for the holidays to purchase the Sony Bravia W-series 52 inch lcd tv so that, lucky me, I could set it up for them.  I will mention that this TV is being used solely for free, over the air digital broadcasting and not for cable or satellite TV, so I will review it as such.First, Amazon was, well, amazing.  We purchased the TV on the Friday afternoon after Christmas, told it would arrive between Jan 6 - 15, but actually received it on New Year's eve, less than 3 full business days after ordering it!  Amazon's delivery contractor was excellent, their tracking system was on top of the order from beginning to end, and they had two guys bring in the television and help set it up on our tv stand.  Score.  After getting a good look at the size of this TV (it's like the size of 2.5 of me!), it is not the sort of thing you would want to load into your car and try to bring home on your own.  This is not even to mention that Amazon's price was at least $300 below the local big electronics retailer (that's not even including the tax I would have had to pay).Set up was brilliantly simple (which is good, b/c I'm a moron when it comes to electronics).  My parents don't speak English, so I was pleased to see that once setup was complete, the TV pretty much worked itself.  I set the TV up with the new Sony bluray player we got using an HDMI cable (Amazon's prices, again, the best for those cables); hooked up our very old vcr with the old analog (3 pronged, red, yellow, and white) cable; hooked up the old rabbit-ear antenna (relieved I didn't need to buy a new one); plugged all these pieces into a surge protector and ta-da! It worked!  I also love love love how the TV instantly detects the external components, so you can put in a videotape, DVD, or bluray disc and push play, and the TV will automatically go to your external device.  (This is good, again, for the electronically challenged among us.)  I should add that there are 4 HDMI outlets on this TV, a PC outlet, and room for at least 4 analog components.Lots of features on this guy:  auto-sensor for ambient light; excellent speakers; Bravia sync which synchronized the TV to our bluray player so they turned on/off in unison; free TV guide programming; power saving options; etc. etc. etc.  Unlike another reviewer, I actually really like the remote control.  It's incredibly user-friendly.  The only thing I would change is that the home button and circular trackpad be moved to the bottom and the channel & volume buttons be moved to the middle.The picture is good.  I think, though, that I was expecting a lot better.  There is still some evidence (or more evidence than I'd prefer) of pixelation despite all the fanfare regarding the 120Hz and digital signal.  Potential buyers should take care in picking the appropriate sized TV for their room, as this will only emphasize the pixelation if you get a TV too large for your space.I don't know if this is something that will get ironed out in the future, but the letterboxing (i.e. the black bars on the sides or on top & bottom of the program being viewed) is kinda annoying.  You can switch from channel to channel or even (when on the same channel) from program to program and you'll see different variations on the letter boxing.  I was watching the local news which had no letter-boxing, then they'd run a commercial that had letterboxing on the sides of the screen, then the next commercial would have letterboxing on both sides AND on the top and bottom of the screen, etc. etc.  Sony made it easier to deal with this with the simple touch of the ""Wide"" button on the remote, but you have to adjust it with every single program and/or channel.  It would be nice if there were some way that this was fixed universally or if Sony could have automatically adjusted the picture to the perfect zoom.  (Sigh, maybe I ask too much.)  As I said, perhaps this will be ironed out once the networks adjust to only digital signals.Very happy with the purchase and I think you definitely get your money's value with this tv.",2,2,0.007982468,0.010723017,0.9812945

"When I first got this TV, the first thing I did was hook it up to my PC to check out what some of my favorite games looked like on it. At 1080p, the image quality with maxed settings was breathtaking! I was so very happy with the quality of picture that I started looking into other ways to really flesh out my purchase. Thus began the assembly of my home theater system...After purchasing speakers, a receiver, and a blu ray player, I found out what I was missing out on. Blu Rays on this TV are just astounding quality! With the whole setup, it is quite the experience. Netflix HD is a must have to enjoy this TV daily unless you want to pay quite a bit for Comcast HD. I find that standard def comcast does of course look rather bad on it, but it will look bad on any HD because it is Standard Definition Signal.The inputs are lacking, this is very true. That is why I went ahead and bought a receiver so that it could handle all of my inputs and adjust them as needed instead of relying on the limits of the TVs settings. When paired with a receiver, this TV as a display is just about perfect to my eyes. It came with no visual defects nor scuffs. It now rests firmly on my wall where it has been mounted for almost a year. If you do plan to mount it, do all the measuring and drilling first and then get a friend or two to help you hang it as it could be dangerous to attempt alone.For the price, I would recommend this TV for just about any setup. The larger screen sizes I assume have the same quality panel and would work in a much larger room, but this size would probably be about as big as one would ever want in a bedroom.",2,2,0.0010933533,0.0015930968,0.99731356

"It's a good addition to an emergency kit, though I'll definitely have to keep the instruction manual right with it, along with a paper clip so I can push the little ""reset"" button if needed, as well as a flat head screwdriver so I can open that blasted battery cover.  That's probably my biggest problem with this emergency radio - clawing at the battery cover with my nails and trying to pry it up gets me nothing but a broken nail.  I need either a butter knife or a flat head screwdriver to pry it open, and I fear that the plastic cover will break after doing this a number of times.  The battery cover needs to be redesigned to be easier to open.  If the power's out and I needed to put AAA batteries in this thing, I'd be quite peeved if I was somewhere that I didn't have a tool to help me open the battery cover.Using the hand crank will be a last resort.  The instructions say that to prevent overheating damage, not to crank faster than 2 rotations per second, and do not crank continuously for more than 2 minutes at a time (for every 2 minutes you crank, you then need to give it a 2 minute rest).  This sounds a bit tedious but in true extended emergency when there's no batteries to be found, I suppose I can deal with it.I do wish it took AA batteries instead of AAA batteries since I tend to keep more AA batteries on hand.  Otherwise, it works.  The weather station comes in fine, as well as AM and FM stations.  Scrolling through stations is a bit tiresome but at least it does have a ""seek"" feature - when I hold down the tuning button, it skips forward to the next clear radio station.  When I turn off the radio and then turn it back on, it does remember the station I had it on last.  The LED flashlight isn't the brightest but it'll be useful in an extended emergency when all my AA-battery operated LED flashlights have died out.  My cell phone isn't a smartphone and charging it from this was slow, but better than nothing in an emergency.  The solar charging function is useful - it seems this radio doesn't need to be outside for it to charge via solar.  I had it sitting on the living room floor in a patch of sunlight that was coming through the skylight and it was charging.In summary, it's something I'll be glad to have when the power goes out - but it's not perfect.  If there are any longevity issues with this device, I'll be sure to update my review.",2,1,0.13047916,0.7443326,0.12518817

The anti-static wipe they provided in the box was the first one I've ever used that actually kept dust from getting on the screen for the 30 seconds it took me to get the screen protector installed.

"I believe this is the first combination of 360 radar detection with visual mapping and controls through an iphone/ipad running an app. The relatively low price plus the visual coordination/control/mapping functions of the app on the iphone/ipod make this an attractive purchase for someone who already owns either an iphone or an ipod.

Specifically, location based alerts used for red-light cameras and GPS settings are only available for the iphone. In practical terms, this means you really should use this device with an iphone.Why not five stars then? Two reasons: 1) The AURA database used for mapping the stoplight cameras, while claiming updates every 12 hours has been found to be in actuality far less often updated than its main competitor, the Escort Defender database and moreover, tends to leave previous sites in the database even after they are no longer active. 2) The actual distance/sensitivity for Cobra's radar detection is not as good as the high-end (and far pricier of course) units available from a couple of its competitors.Of course, no one should be a speed demon just because ""no one is looking"" but if you travel with a slightly heavy foot and want to reduce your risk of paying pricey tickets, this is a cost-effective way of using leading-edge technology.",2,2,0.025777088,0.097660415,0.8765625

"This is probably the best surge protector that I've owned. I bought it mostly because Tripp Lite is the highest rated brand for surge protectors, and it has a 10ft cord! I replaced my old surge protector (a comparable product) with this one, and this one takes up less space.My old surge protector had 8 plugs just like this one, except all the plugs were very close together and it was one long strip.

The non-transformer plugs have quite a bit of room between them, so that older plugs won't interfere in terms of spacing.My old surge protector only had 1 coax pair, which was okay as I never used it. This Tripp Lite one has 2 coax pair--one for satellite and one for antenna. In addition it has a telephone jack to protect the telephone equipment from being destroyed.Each port on the Tripp Lite can only support one device. The directions and warranty state that you should not plug an extension cord into this unit. The insurance will be void for whatever is plugged into the extension cord, but it will not cause a fire or hurt you if you use it with ONE, low-power device like a laptop computer or LCD monitor. DO NOT USE it with a portable heater or microwave, as the power draw will be more than 15 amps and cause the breaker in the surge protector to trip.This is one of the best, well designed, surge protectors that you can buy.",2,2,0.00055660243,0.0015566974,0.9978867
"This is by far the best keyboard by leaps and bounds, that I've got the privilege to use. I've used the microsoft sidewinder gaming backlit keyboard, and also a high end kinesis keyboard.I use this keyboard for both programming, and gaming. What makes this keyboard stand out from the other keyboards, is the build quality. The keys while plastic in construction, feel extremely solid, almost like metal. The key action is phenomenal, each key press is so precise, as if it's guided on rails. Supposedly, the keys are rated for 3x the typical key presses before failure.The back lit option works wonderfully. There are 4 settings, off, low, med, high. The integrated cord which connects the keyboard to the PC is extremely heavy duty, and long. The keyboard has 2 additional built in usb ports, which are useful for connecting your mouse, or any other usb device. This came in really handy as my work laptop had one usb outlet that was marginally faulty. The wrist rest while not cushioned, feels extremely comfortable. It is made of the same material as the keys.One last thing to note, it took about one night to get used to this keyboard. Strangely, the keys felt slightly differently spaced from regular keyboards. What I suspect is the keys are identically spaced to regular keyboards, but it is the key action which takes a while to get used to. Typing on this keyboard feels more precise, and initially, it feels a little harder to type on the keyboard, but as time progressed, I feel that I am getting used to the key action.In summary, highly recommended for both programming, and gaming. I'm quite confident that this keyboard's ctrl key and shift key will last longer than my microsoft sidewinder's left ctrl and shift key which had started to become semi unresponsive, due to repeated mashing from gaming.",2,2,0.0009969467,0.0022847808,0.9967182

"I really was expecting these to be a failed purchase. I thought I'd give them a go almost as a novelty... I feel silly now, as they are brilliant. Driver dependency is heavy, don't expect to just plug them in and go as some of the larger clunkier ones would allow with onboard drivers or the ability to use generics. But really it would be kind of giddy to assume otherwise with these things that are so small as to seem unlikely to be effective in any real-world applications.I would do a pro / con, but have no cons.... Perhaps because I just expected the worst, leaving me with nowhere to go but up.- Size: Tiny - I can *almost* close the USB flap on a Dell Duo Convertible with the thing in. I would forget they were in a USB hub if not for the flashing LED. They are practically nonexistent in a tower USB port, front or back.- Reliability: I have used them in odd situations, and have yet for them to be the source of an issue. Mixed NIC environments present the usual hazards, but nothing additional that I've noticed.- Range: Again, I have had low expectations, and so I used them mostly so close to the wireless source that I couldn't judge fairly. They have fit the bill at 25+ feet from the nearest active AP handily. Walls and obstacles have not buggered the connectivity. That's more than I would have expected, your situation may differ.- Price: Cheap, especially considering the awkward situations that they can be used to resolve temporary issues and the time sink potential in those situations if you don't have a quick-and-dirty answer. I will likely keep a small stack of them around indefinitely.So far I have used these in scenarios like:- Emergency connectivity for DNS server mishaps on domains- A replacement for troublesome hard-connections in nearby Win 7 64 workstations- As a makeshift NIC array via a USB hub for Windows 2008 R2 Datacenter servers requiring multiple connections but lacking the hardware- Onboard fail-safe connection (by pluging one into the unusually placed USB slots on Dell and Supermicro server boards, just leaving them there,disabled or otherwise inactive, just in case all other options are bunk)- Near invisible wireless connections on Netbooks, Dell Duo Convertibles, Legacy laptops.I can't attest fully to their cross platform usage yet. But I have several unusual server and wokrstation builds across the SUSE and Ubuntu spectrum that I will certainly be giving them a test on. I have a pretty fair expectation that as long as the drivers install as expected, they will be effective there too...I have used them as a guest captured NIC for Linux and Windows virtual appliances and servers with some success, but as there is a significant abstraction layer there, that doesn't seem like an overall statement about their usage in a standalone environment.So this is one of those times when a shot-in-the-dark actually has paid off in volume... I would (and will) purchase more of them, either for specific applications or more likely as a brilliant addition to my ""what if"" toolset.If there is a downside, I haven't found it yet...and I have used them in some pretty weird circumstances so far... There may well be better out there, I just stumbled on these, didn't really invest in thorough product research. I grabbed some of these along with other variant wireless and USB NICs for emergencies and peculiar issues.These are the ones I have used almost every time.

I put this on my d40 and it works fine. Vert button doesn't really work too well and it is annoying to have to go thru 9 steps just to shoot with the vertical button... basically you have to:1. Put camera in remote mode. (which I set up with function button on front for quicker selection)2. Turn on switch on batter pack.3. pop out remote sensor transmitter (basically this pops out the little compartment button on the front that has an inferred transmitter button that points up at the cameras infared sensor)This seems really silly to me because isn't the dang thing already attached to the camera?!?!Other than that it feels pretty solid and does what it needs to.

"Normally I'm not a huge fan of Sony products when it comes to audio quality. I own numerous bluetooth (BT) speakers, however, and this is one of my favorites.This speaker is smaller than you'd think, but gets rather loud. It's dead simple to connect - just hit the ""connect"" button and find it with your phone and it pairs. No passwords, codes, no nonsense.The sound quality is better than you'd expect for a small BT speaker, and amongst the best of any I own (the SoundFreaq SFQ-01 is still the best). It absolutely crushes the Creative SBX20 (which is $200), and is far better than the few tiny fist-sized BT speakers I have laying around. It's got good bass and midrange, and doesn't get too tinny like some other BT speakers get. I really, really like the sound quality.The speaker also has a built in microphone for using it during phone calls. The mic is acceptable, though I really don't think it's something that I'll use much.It's got a small square AC adapter or it runs on AA batteries, which is super handy for doing yardwork!It also has near-field technology, which apparently lets you touch your phone to it and it pairs. I don't get the point (it's not hard to pair), but it's available (my phone doesn't have that tech).Overall, this is one of my favorite BT speakers, and a great value at $79.

"The janitor recently stole the pair of Skullcandies I usually left at work.  I wanted a good music listening pair to replace them.  I recently bought several &#34;cheapish&#34; ear buds, one 20 dollar set, and a set of JVC flat headphones recently.  I couldn't decide based on reviews alone, so tried several different options.  I know it was silly.  I should have just spent it all on one &#34;nice&#34; pair, but I thought it would be fun, and it actually was.  Besides, why give the Janitor such a big target.  ;p  I also discovered different roles for the buds I bought.  They nearly all have a place in my collection.  :]  Win win.I'm no audiophile, or sound professional.  Evenso, I bet I'm like a lot of you.  I want nice sounding music to accompany my day while quieting the environment.  I hope these comparisons will be helpful so you don't have to buy a bundle of buds, and can maybe zero in on a set or two that will serve your tastes best.  I enjoyed comparing and contrasting, and actually noting quit a bit of difference.The buds/phones I tried areiLuv iEP322ORG [orange] in-ear Ultra Bass ~6 dollarsPanasonic RPHJE120K [black] in-ear ~6 dollarsYamaha EPH-20Bu [supposedly blue but actually purple] in- ear ~20 dollarsJVC 10HAFC earphones ~3 dollarsJVC &#34;Flats&#34; on ear headphones black ~12Skullycandy &#34;Ink'd&#34; in ear buds ~15 [already owned, but in for comparison]Sentry Wind-Ups in-ear buds ~5 dollarsiLuv:I chose the orange iLuv's because it was the cheapest color on Amazon.  I enjoyed their sound overall.  They are the most bass heavy of the group.  However, they leave the highs and mids a little neglected.  They also reduce ambient sound decently, so you can focus on what you are listening to.  So while these are not the most balanced, your teen will probably love the sound.  They are also on the &#34;loud&#34; side.  Even at minimum device volume these came in the loudest.  As such, I will probably put these in with one of my DS systems' carrying cases.  It will be great for those, and be on hand so I won't have to scrounge around for a pair, when I want to hear the game and not my wife's TV programs.  These also won't be my work or walking pair, because they don't look very adult [again, your teen will probably love them], and they produce the second most &#34;cord noise&#34; in the group from the cords rubbing on your shoulders or clothes while you are walking or exercising.  If I had nothing else to compare to, I think I'd have been very happy with this set.Panasonic:The Panasonics were probably the quietest of the group.  Sound is relatively balanced, with no real extremes.  Bass seems light for an in ear bud.  They are now my go to bed buds.  I can put my device on minimum volume and easily go to sleep.  The iLuvs and Skullcandy were too loud to be comfortable on both my phone media player and iPad mini's lowest setting for sleeping.  The Panasonics are also small enough, that they weren't uncomfortable for side sleeping.  These also produced the least cord noise from movement, so should be good to walk, exercise in.  Noise reduction was decent and reduced my wife's snoring several decibels.  This might not be so great for outdoor exercise, where you may want to hear your environment for safety.  I may even get a second set or carry mine back and forth so I can walk at lunch break in these, since I have a protected area to walk [no cars, etc.].  The lack of cord noise really makes the difference here.Yamaha:I was curious about what I would get by going a little upmarket.  Granted it's not much of a jump at &#34;only&#34; 20 dollars.  The Yamahas were probably most similar in sound to the Panasonics or JVC flats.  They had a good all around balance and were more full than the Panasonics.  Bass is not prominent, nor is it missing.  They sound best with Classical music in my experience.  On the down side, they were advertised as &#34;blue&#34;, but Yamaha's idea of blue is very clearly Purple.  It's not a major issue, but be aware, if you choose this color.  Cord noise seemed on the loud side, compared to the JVC buds and Panasonics.  I probably would not want to do anything active in them.  However, if I could &#34;only&#34; have one bud, this might be it.JVC HAF10C earbuds:For only around 3 dollars you shouldn't normally expect too much.  Agree?  Well, I already had a blue pair [ 4 dollars at retail] so knew what to expect.  It's a testament I bought another.  This pair was black, and I far prefer the gorgeous blue plastic set, but would not pay a couple extra dollars on Amazon for that choice.  I know it shouldn't matter, but I REALLY like blues.  Anyhow, the most unique feature of this set is the clamshell case you get.  It allows you to wind your cord and protect the buds.  I wish higher quality buds would do this.  I'd pay a couple extra bucks for it.  The case does not work well for most in-ear buds, I would guess.  I am able to get the above Yamahas in one case [why I ordered an extra set], but it is not a perfect fit.  Larger buds probably won't fit.  The buds themsevles have a durable hard plastic casing and should be quite durable.  Sound is actually nice, for non-in ear buds.  For the price I doubt you'd find better sound.  They are also on the quiet side, and not being directly in ear, you could probably give these to your kids without the threat of hearing damage you might get from louder and in ear buds.  I use these to walk, talk radio, and some music.  Unlike most in-ear, I can wear comfortably all day if I loosely cradle them on ear.  While outdoors, they allow you to hear the environment, including wind, which is a downside.  Fortunately, they do not generate the cord noise that is such a pet peeve of mine.  Great all around value.  I don't know that the value can be beat for the quality of plugs, and the very well designed case.  Being so cheap, I also don't have to fret too much if the Janitor decides to steal this pair also.JVC &#34;Flats&#34;:These are on ear headphones, so probably not fair to compare to ear buds.  Still they were part of my purchase, so I am including for contrast.  At only 12 dollars, I was very surprised how crisp and clean these sounded.  They delivered a balanced spectrum, without sacrificing bass as I'd expected.  They do not isolate noise as well as in-ear, but you do get some reduction without having to turn your music WAY up.  For straight music listening or watching a video, I might choose these most of the time at home.  They do not seem to generate cord noise due to movement, but are bulkier than what I want to walk in.  They also fold &#34;flat&#34; making them a nice travel pair for people who don't like in-ear buds.  I keep mine in an inexpensive ipad mini neoprene case, for example.  Would be easy to take on a plane.  I have a big head [really], despite their diminuitive size, they adjusted to fit very comfortably.  I can wear for long sessions, without bother.  Can't go wrong with these.Skullcandy &#34;Ink'd&#34;:This may not be a fair comparison either.  I think these had the greatest &#34;retail&#34; price when they were new, but I bought them on sale at Ross stores for about 15 dollars.  These are a few years old, so might be an older make than what is available now.  However, I am still surprised by how good these sound to me.  Of all the ear buds in my collection these are probably my favorite for music.  It figures, after buying several, the one I had still sounded best to me.  It has plenty of bass, without sacrificing the overall quality like the iLuvs seem to.  However, it is still one of the loudest of my collection, and is uncomfortable to sleep with on my devices.  My radio is more sensitive and can tune more quietly, but I rarely use that to sleep to.  This set also probably produces the most cord noise of any ear buds meaning they won't walk the beat with me.  It also features metallic red and white buds, white cord, and the companies trade mark as a red skull.  While I think they look &#34;cool&#34; the skull and colors all look a little childish.  They are not as garish as the iLuvs, but they are certainly second in my comparison.  That said, there are more sedate colorings available, however they all have the contrasting skull logo in some fashion or other.  As such these will mostly be used privately.Sentry Wind-ups:These were my least favorite.  I was drawn in by the promise of a nifty carry case again.  I might have kept just for that, if they'd have worked.  However, the cord winder was rather difficult to accuate, at least for my biggish hands.  Also my pair of buds may have been defective.  The right bud produced only half the volume of the left.  I took back to Wal-mart asap.  At only 5 dollars, I didn't expect much, but I did expect balance across left and right.  I would presume that was a single item issue, but I did not want to get a second pair to find out.  Sound was more hollow than most I tried, not even measuring up to the 3 dollar JVC's.There it is.  I hope you've these comments helpful in finding your pair.",2,2,0.045760375,0.05067314,0.9035665

"I LOVE my Kindle Fire 8.9&#34; HDX, but am frustrated at the lack of apps for it. I am SO glad that Apotop has a Kindle Fire app so that us Kindle users can use this!My daughter has a lot of shows that I have burned to a 1 TB external hard drive. But my Kindle only has 16 GB of memory, which clearly holds next to nothing. Rather than paying a small fortune to get 64GB memory, I spent $50 on the 1 TB external hard drive and got this product to stream the movies. And it works really well.This is similar to the Kingston Mobilite, which sells for about $20-$30. The difference between the two is that this one is bigger and made of higher quality materials. The Mobilite is small, light and cheap feeling, whereas this has a nice, rubbered texture to it. It's not &#60;as&#62; small as some, so if true portability is your thing, you may consider the Kingston instead.This lets you connect an external hard drive, USB drive, or SD card. It creates its own wireless network that you can connect your device to, and allows you to access whatever is plugged in. So, I connect my 1 TB external hard drive and can stream all the movies my daughter wants to watch to our Kindle Fire. It's ingenious, really.This can also charge a smartphone in a pinch, but I would not buy this for that reason alone, as there are far higher capacity portable chargers for less money out there. You can also copy data, but cannot delete anything attached to the device, which is a bit strange.Make sure you encrypt your wifi signal (it doesn't come encrypted), as anyone can access your data.Overall this is a very useful product for those that need to expand their tablet (or laptop, or whatever) memory without paying a fortune.

"I had purchased Energizer rechargeable batteries with a cute ""automatic"" charger included. The ""automatic"" part referred to an 8-hour timer built into it. You pop in the batteries, plug it in and whether the batteries wanted it or not they got a full 8-hour charge. The batteries gave outstanding performance compared to the pricey alkalines. But within six months the rechargeables lost probably half of their nominal 2400 mAh capacity.My NiMH Energizers were advertised to be good for 1000 charging cycles, but that amount was turning more like 100 if not less. I figured that the 8-hour charge can't be too healthy for them so I decided to look for a better charger with automatic detection and adjustment of the charging times for each individual battery.I considered several good automatic chargers that treat each battery individually. The Sony BCG-34HRMD4 seemed optimal because of the following: (1) very reasonable price with the four great batteries included, (2) universal 110-240 voltage, (3) no-frills individual indication of the charging process, (4) rejuvenate function - very handy even for NiMH batteries, (5) ease of use - it was going to be used by several people with differing degrees of tech expertise.I didn't want a super-duper split-second blink-your-eye quick charger because I am not in a real hurry to get the batteries charged plus high charging currents heat up the batteries to a boil and shorten their life span. ""Normal"" was fine for my needs, so I was actually pleased to read in the reviews that the ""Super Quick"" is false advertisement. Shame on you Sony!Overall: this is a very good charger, highly recommended. It carries a reputable brand name, so it is likely to last a long time without surprises. And, last but not least, it is cheap - thank to the working men, women and children of China.===== Edit =====I noticed that the price has changed. The price is rather crucial for my positive review. I bought this charger and rated it full 5 stars when it was $24.99 apiece with a free shipping.===== Edit on May 26, 2009 =====Charger still running strong after 3+ years. It is used extensively by many people, and I replaced all batteries for Eneloops which are performing really great. Nothing broke in the charger except that someone took off the top lid and lost it - no big deal because the batteries get better cooling without it. I also have BC-900 charger but prefer the Sony with single button for ""refresh"".Again: a great product. Highly recommended.",2,0,0.7384027,0.16682537,0.09477193
"I'd had my eye on the Samsung LN-R**8W series for quite some time after starting to see them in various places used as monitors for PCs and as televisions hooked up to XBox 360s. Every time I saw one of these sets (the demo models were invariably the 23"" version), I had to stop and stare. Usually the game playing was ""Call of Duty 2"", but it looked positively stunning. Finally I watched some high-def programming at a store on the 26"" model and I was sold. Having read not a single on-line review and without doing any research whatsoever, I was sold by my eyes alone. The only 'research' I did was comparing this set to other brands, and this was the clear winner.The 3000:1 contrast ratio is misleading. They used 'dynamic' contrast ratio to come up with that figure. I've since learned the actual contrast ratio as used by most other manufacturers is around 800:1, which is still among the best of the current crop. The next generation will undoubtedly beat this figure. But for my purposes, this set is just fantastic. The blacks are black, and all shades of gray seem to come through as intended. To judge this, I'm replaying ""Deus Ex"", a PC game from back in 2000 (which runs fine in WinXP and supports 1360 x 768). This game takes place entirely at night, so there are a lot of dark areas along with many shades of gray. This game looks amazing, as does FarCry (2004) with its beautiful vivid tropical colors and water. Those are the only two games I've tried thus far. And I imagine games that natively support 1360 x 768 will naturally fare better on this set. For instance, a game that only supports 1024 x 768 will probably look kinda crappy because of scaling problems, a problem all LCD monitors share when not running in their native resolution.I'm using it primarily as a huge monitor for my PC. I had to think hard about this, because using this set as a PC monitor, your screen resolution will max out at 1360 x 768, which is great for television, but hardly cutting-edge for a computer monitor. However, to find a PC monitor this BIG with ultra-high resolution would have set me back about double the dollars. And since my rig (An Athlon 2600+ with an NVidia 6600GT video card) isn't capable of playing games at ultra-high res anyway, I'm happy with this. Also, I've since learned that this series of sets is the easiest to configure for computer use. It's got a VGA port on the back, so just buy a VGA cable, hook it to your PC, and it's Plug-And-Play. Just remember before unhooking your old monitor to resize the screen in Windows to 1360 x 768 so it boots to the correct size after you hook this up.Picture quality is excellent. The best I've ever seen in an LCD. They're all pretty decent these days, but this one stands out as brighter, sharper, crisper, clearer, at least to my eyes. Before buying anything this expensive though, I'd make sure you actually see various brands in action at various stores before you buy.I don't have high-def service at home yet, so the only HD I've viewed on this has been at the store, but it looked awesome to me.Picture-in-picture is really only useful if you're surfing the net and want to watch TV at the same time. For that, it's great, though you'll have to manually use the remote to activate sound in PIP each time. An annoyance. The speakers sound clear and crisp. Not huge, but nice-sounding.And now, the only flaw I've found: Out of the box, the reds can be oversaturated when contrasted with black. I've only noticed this with text; graphics are fine. I might be able to adjust this in the set's menu, but haven't tried it yet, because otherwise it looks just absolutely perfect and I hate to mess with it.",2,2,0.0019033392,0.001655721,0.99644095
Normally I stay away from Monster's products as they tend to be very over-priced but this was surprisingly cheap on amazon and it has an amazing build quality to it. It is rather stiff and will not bend very easy so that can be both a pro and a con depending on your view. Very happy with the deal. I would definitely not pay more than $15 I spent on it though.

"I bought this Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000 to replace my old Kensington wireless laser mouse, which was only 2 weeks old but I was so frustrated with it since day one due to its serious lack of response.The Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000 is very easy to install, including the software. I am extremely impressed by how fast and accurate it responds to clicks and scrolling. The scroll wheel is comfortable and very QUIET as it turns. I looked at other reviews about Logitech mice where a lot users complained about how noisy some Logitech mice would make as you turned the scroll wheels. Not a problem with this Microsoft mouse.I also like the two side buttons because they are customizable. I have customized the left side button to launch the Web browser and it works very nicely! I have not customized the left side button yet but I'm sure I will find good use of it.The only one issue I have experienced is the mouse overall feels quite slippery when it is new. I figure over time once I have accumulated enough hand oil and dirt on the mouse, I will get better grip. I wish Microsoft would ""rubberize"" the two sides of the mouse like Kensington has done. Having rubber feel makes a big difference in terms of gripping the mouse and moving it around your table top as you mouse like crazy.Overall I highly recommend this mouse.",2,2,0.0009104426,0.0048943446,0.9941953

"Without the SU-800 commander, remote strobes (SB-600, 800, 900) are fired using the camera's pop-up flash, or with an SB mounted on the camera's hotshoe. This introduces what may be undesirable light from the front as well as a less-than-attractive pinpoint catchlight in the eyes of the subject.  Popular workarounds involve using a small strobe-mounted softbox (which softens the light from the front and increases the size of the catchlight) or using tape to cover the pop-up flash.  Unfortunately, if the tape is opaque enough to block the light, it also blocks the signal to the remote strobes.  Ultimately, the easy and elegant solution - the end to fixes and workarounds - is to spring for the SU-800!",2,2,0.042639837,0.22304842,0.7343117

"I had never heard of Marumi filters before so was a little wary when I ordered their polarizing filter the first time. Yes I said the first time. I now own several different sizes: 58mm, 62mm, 67mm and 77mm and have been very happy with them. I have owned and used several other brand name polarizers and can tell you there are differences between some of them and the Marumis.The Marumis are very thin but still unscrew easily from the lens unlike several other brands that get stuck and need filter wrenches to remove. I have never had a problem removing any of the Marumis from any of my lenses. The Marumis also differ in how they control reflections and darken skies. They are not as aggressive as some of the others meaning they do NOT darken a blue sky as drastically. If you like a dark almost black sky, you might not like the effect Marumis produce. They will darken a blue sky but I think it's a more pleasing and realistic result than some of the other brands. Neither is good or bad to me, it's all personal preference. The Marumis control reflections well and I have had no problems reducing the reflected light on water.All in all I am very happy with these filters.

"I have tried a few of the very cheap Bluetooth transmitters. They always had transmission and sound quality issues so I knew that I had to break down and spend more for the right solution.  I don't have apt-x for my headphones but the sound is very solid with this device used as a transmitter. Did not expect the sound to be this good.  I haven't tried it as a receiver yet. The battery could last a little longer but it's fine.  Pairing isn't bad either.Here is something I found out about the audio lag. When I watch cable TV and use the transmitter for my headphones I think the main reason for the delay is that I use the HDMI connection between the cable box and the TV for the video. When I'm using my headphones to hear the audio when my wife is asleep I then turn the TV speaker sound all the way down.  I then use the bluetooth transmitter attached to the analog (RCA) audio output connections. The time lag between the HDMI signal going to the TV and the analog audio signal going to the headphones is noticeable, not bad but it's definitely there. When I use the analog inputs to BOTH the TV from my WD TV Live AND to the transmitter from the Avantree - so that the video and the audio are simultaneously coming from analog outputs - the lag is infinitesimal.This little guy is worth the extra expense.",2,2,0.007382376,0.07453597,0.9180816

"I was glad to read all of the reviews before purchasing this unit. At first, I wasn't sure if my Samsung TV had an optical audio output.  Fortunately it does.  The unfortunate part of it is that I purchased a separate optical cable, not knowing that the Yamaha soundbar includes the cable.  But once I connected everything (making sure that I removed the plastic cap and ensuring that the cable connector clicked into the socket), the difference was amazing... rich tonality, clarity, fullness, and ambiance.  The reason for giving a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the internal subwoofer was not as bassy as much as I would have liked for watching action movies, but for every other TV programs this was perfect.  And for listening to the Pandora Internet Radio App through the Samsung TV, the sound was tremendously better than through the TV speakers... what a huge difference (a much fuller and richer sound).  After reading through the user manual to program the soundbar to respond to the TV remote, I was able to control the volume with it.

"Although I'm aware of the dimension of this center channel speaker, I still got shocked when I unpacked the package. It is a huge unit and I'm really glad I didn't choose the even bigger CS2 (even if it should sound better). First of all, you have to make sure you have the room for a solid 7 inch high box.I replaced the center of my Energy Take Classic 5.1 with this CS1. The first impression is disappointing. The vocal from CS1 sounds like coming from a distance hallway and it's missing the entire range of sound. However, after playing two movies at low-mid sound level, the sound improved creditably. I won't say it's clearer than the Energy center, but the overall performance is definitely better than the Energy center.The good:Voice from movies is very clear and crisp (if the Energy center is 10, this CS1 can score 9-9.5)Wonderful bassLooks nice if you have the room to fit itInexpensiveThe Bad:Require serious break-in before usingOther Thoughts:I'm pairing it with 2 M60 fronts and 2 R300 surrounds.

"I own two Lumix cameras. The LX3 and the ZS3. They are two completely different animals. The LX3 is, in my opinion, digital equivalent to a Leica in the 1930's. It is a very sophisticated camera with a wide view in it's fast, Leica, world-class lens. The only drawback is the short zoom. I gladly sacrifice the zoom length for the control overrides and other professional features this camera offers. The ZS3 being reviewed here also sports a world-class Leica lens but it is, by nature, nowhere near as fast. I try never to take flash photos with a point and shoot as I find the results appalling. This is true of both of these Lumix cameras. The LX3 however has a hot shoe for a good flash that works extrememly well. I did not realize that the ZS3 does not have a hot shoe so I do not use it much once the sun goes down or indoors at night. I bought the ZS3 for the long zoom lens (300mm) and I have been very pleased with it. The pair of cameras satisfies just about all my needs in digital point and shoot cameras.",2,2,0.0026518789,0.014959515,0.9823887

"I'm very happy with this camera's balance of price to performance.This is my first digital camera. I have a degree in photography, although my job is not shooting now. I've used digital cameras occasionally on the job, but have been holding out at home, using film. Film is very comfortable for me. But we wanted to start to share photos with distant family, quicker.One thing I decided was to limit my shopping to just one brand (my old FE2 imparts some serious loyalty). I don't have time to compare feature for feature and spec for spec, all these different brands and prices and stuff. I realized I had to make my decision work for what I was going to shoot and who would be using the camera. We go camping, we visit relatives, we bake cookies: average family activities. The camera will be used by me, my wife, and our kids (6 & 8). I'm considering this camera my gateway to digital, and plan on using it for several years at least. Given that, plus...My list of features to make my decision:Nikon was my base brand unless I couldn't find something that fit.Manual exposure and shutter control.Time lapse (nice to have, not mandatory).Ability to turn off the LCD screen and use an optical viewfinder. (P50 can do it on some modes, not all)AA batteries.Less buttons = better.8 MPAbout $200, plus or minus $50.Mac-savvy.This list helped me make a decision fairly quickly, and I didn't lose any sleep over not looking at 20 more-similar-than-different options in the marketplace.  This camera fit, and I've been very happy. My only issue, which I hear is true of all these cameras in this price range, is the lag time on the shutter. I'm convinced we have Gigs of cheap memory only because camera manufacturers need a way of mitigating this serious shortcoming of digital cameras in this price range.I haven't installed the software on my Mac, because iPhoto is perfectly acceptable for what I'm doing: sharing a few pix, ordering prints, and getting organized. I just plugged in the P50 and iPhoto launched automatically.So far, I've taken great pictures in the daylight, no-flash indoors, several modes. Everyone in the family has tried it out with success.  So far, so good, no issues.I also looked at the P5100 (outside my $, plus it had more buttons than the P50).",2,2,0.0006697912,0.0021314502,0.9971988

"I would like to give my opinion about the Lumix LX7 camera (referred wrongly by many as a point and shoot camera). I am an experienced amateur photographer, have owned many different cameras like Leicas, Hasselblad and Nikons from the film age. Presently I own a Pentax K30 with a wide assortment of lenses which I think is a fantastic camera, so I guess I know what I am talking about.When you talk about digital cameras, there is a school of thought that puts a lot of emphasis on the pixel count, noise at the pixel level and comparisons based on many technical aspects with very little consideration about the actual results and their intended use. Let me clarify. I shoot my pictures for my pleasure and like to view and show them in a screen, with the occasional print of the ones a Ilke best of up to 20 inches in the largest dimension. And I guess that I am among a very large group of photographers in this respect. So, the intended use is of primary importance in my analysis.My daughter is a professional photographer, so she uses full frame Nikons and Canons and her pictures have a different intended use, large prints among them. So, her analysis would be different from mine.So, what do I look in a camera, given my needs? Let me make a list of requirements.1. High quality2. Good ergonomics3. Wide angle4. Low weight for casual photography and travel5. Fast lens6. Good zoom range7. Sharp results8. RAW capability9. Use of optic filters, like an UV, Neutral or CPL10. Good battery life11. Reasonable price12. Moderate to low noise at high ISO settings13. Eye level viewfinder14. Fast focusing15. Good screen for composing and viewing16. Good movie capabilitiesObviously, most of these requirements are met by a DSRL, like my Pentax K30, except perhaps and arguably by the movie capability which in this case is just adequate and the requirement of low weight. Any DSRL, including the Pentax are heavy and more so after a  day of carrying it, along with an assortment of lenses. But I needed a camera that, while satisfying all my requirements was both reasonable in size and weight and that not a pain in the neck (literally) to carry around and allowed me to be fairly inconspicuous while shooting.After reviewing the available options, and I considered all the obvious ones, like the Sony RX100, the Canon S models and the high end Nikon compacts, it was obvious to me that the best alternative by far was the Panasonic LX7 for several reasons, in spite of being a model introduced 2 years ago.Let me start with the end result and then I will cover the details and the reasons I opted for this camera. It is a fantastic camera of high quality build that gives excellent results and it&#8217;s a joy to use.Now let me get into specifics. I will tackle my list of requirement individually, but my review will necessarily be limited to what I consider the relevant points.1. High qualityThe construction of this camera is flawless with a metal body. You can fell the quality as you hold it in your hands. Almost every review I have read about this camera has a negative opinion of the battery/SD card open latch, calling it flimsy and detracting from the general high quality construction. In my opinion this is a moot point as my experience with several point & shoot Panasonic cameras I have owned is that it works perfectly, and I believe that the reason Panasonic continues to use it is that it works and it is durable. This camera is built to last and at the same time is a thing of beauty that you are proud to own.2. Good ergonomicsThe camera feels just right in your hands, has an excellent grip to your right side that gives a good one handed hold on it. All the controls are in the right places, at least in my opinion, are easy to operate and secure in holding their position. You will not move a control inadvertently, that&#8217;s for sure. One of the criticisms that are offered is that the lens cap has to be removed each time you turn on the camera. I personally, coming from the film era cameras find this totally natural and it doesn&#8217;t bother me at all. Anyhow, I have purchased an accessory lens cap, three leafed that opens automatically when you turn on the camera and that works beautifully. I alternate between these two lens covers, depending where I carry the camera. This one is an inexpensive gadget that can be bought at Amazon or eBay and it&#8217;s very easy to install or remove.One word of caution: remember always to attach the small cord provided to secure the original lens cap to the camera body so to not loose it inadvertently.I particularly liked the aperture control ring and the aspect ratio selection switch, both operating directly through the lens mount. Very convenient.3. Wide angleThe lens has fantastic wide angle capabilities. The equivalent 35mm maximum is 24mm, but a would like to give a word of caution. These measures are used always in reference to an aspect ratio that is all right if you just crop the picture to give the aspect ratio you want. No so in the case of the LX7. The sensor has more pixels than the ones you get in the actual picture, and so, if you use the 3:2 ratio you get the 24mm coverage. But if you go to the 16:9 ratio, the LX7 takes away a portion of the upper and lower parts of the picture but adds to the left and right sides, so that what you get in this case is a coverage of almost 21mm. The same happens, in the opposite direction with the other aspect ratios available, 4:3 and 1:1. To my knowledge this is not provided by any other camera I know of.4. Low weight for casual photography and travelThis camera is not tiny by any means, but neither it is unreasonable large and its weight is adequate to carry it all day long with no undue strain. I normally carry it in a case that is attached to my belt (I use the leather model that provides sturdy protection and it&#8217;s nice to look at) and always have it with me. Occasionally I can carry the camera on the pocket of my jacket. In this case I use the alternate lens cover that I mentioned earlier.5. Fast lensIn this respect, the LX7 shines. It has the most luminous lens in the compact camera market, as far as I know. It has a maximum aperture of 1.4 at maximum aperture and 2.3 at its longest telephoto setting. All other cameras considered may have a good maximum aperture (though none comes near the 1.4) but the telephoto end is way over the 2.3 that the LX7 achieves. Just look at the specs of the LX7 competitors and you get the idea.6. Good zoom rangeThe zoom range of the LX7 covers most of my shooting needs. I tend to use the wide angle settings more often than the telephoto, and there are some occasions where I need more than an 90mm equivalent range. For these cases (not very numerous for me) I am considering buying a long telephoto compact camera to carry around as a supplement, instead of my DSRL with a telephoto lens. The Panasonic range has some very good possibilities, with very sharp Leica lenses that will fit my bill. Consider this as having a very long zoom lens for your DSRL, and compare the size and weight. You get my point. If you consider cost and weight this is a no brainer.I believe this will be the way to go for me. You can carry the LX7 for most of your shooting and use the other compact camera for long range shooting at an acceptable level of quality when you need it.7. Sharp resultsThe lens and sensor combination of the LX7 gives amazing results, even when shooting at full aperture. In all honesty, I can&#8217;t tell the difference between pictures taken with the LX7 and the Pentax. Probably I would see a difference in large prints but I don&#8217;t have the need for these. I believe this Leica Summilux zoom lens is among the sharpest lenses I have ever used.8. RAW capabilityThe LX7 can shoot in both RAW and JPEG formats or both simultaneously. I shoot all my pictures in RAW and am able to extract full detail. Incidentally, the LX7 produces RAW files with a color depth of 16 bits, while my Pentax gives me RAW files with a color depth of 12 bits only. I cannot the tell the difference in my monitor or in the prints I have made. Probably this has importance for large professional work and in this particular respect the LX7 may have an advantage. I can extract good details from the light and dark areas, especially from the lights.9. Use of optic filters, like an UV, Neutral or CPLA good capability that the LX7 has is that you can use threaded 37mm filters. The only thing you need is an unexpensive adapter ring that is very easy to install. This is a very distinctive advantage that the LX7 has that I have not seen pointed out in most of the reviews I have read. The other big advantage it has is the incorporated neutral density filter that is built in the camera and can be used by the push of a dedicated button. Again, to my knowledge no other camera in this category has this capability.10. Reasonable priceThe LX7 also has a nice price advantage over most of its rivals, especially the Sony RX100 line. You can get it now in Amazon for around 340 dollares, although the price fluctuates and is a good idea to check it regularly. I bought mine in Amazon, used, like new, including a spare battery and case for around 220 dollars. It was in perfect condition and you can&#8217;t beat that price.11. Moderate to low noise at high ISO settingsI have found that noise is not a problem up to 800 ISO. The settings of 1600 and 3200 produced and amount of noise that could be managed nicely in post processing and for computer use and small prints ISO 6400 is adequate. In BW pictures, noise can be used to your advantage, giving that special grain look that you achieved using Kodak Tri X film.12. Eye level viewfinderAnother of the critics I have found in the review is that the LX7  does not have an eye level viewfinder. In some cases it is not mentioned the existence of an electronic viewfinder, the LVF2, that is attached to the flash accessory shoe. I adds bulk to the camera (you can still pocket it in your jacket) and you can not use the case with it. But although is an expensive item, it is of very good quality, giving a very clear and detailed image that can be used in any circumstance, especially bright outdoors. It has the added advantage that it can be tilted up to 90 degrees, giving the possibility of waist level shooting. For me is a must have accessory.13. Fast focusingI have found that the focusing speed of the LX7 is nothing short of fantastic, even in low light, making this camera an excellent low light one in combination to its very fast lens. In this respect, it cannot be beaten, given the very sharp results you can get using its maximum aperture.14. Good screen for composing and viewingThe screen is very good, with resolution over 900 K pixels, with good contrast and magnification when using it for viewing your pictures. The only thing I would have liked is a capability for tilting it. But I can live without it and the possibility of tilting the electronic viewfinder is a good substitute for it.I don&#8217;t have a need for filming in most instances, but in those moments I used the LX7 for filming I was surprised by the very high quality of the clips I obtained. But my thing is photography, so I cannot fully evaluate the capabilities of this camera in this respect to this.I always thought that the camera is a tool for taking photographs, the more important component of a good photo being the photographer. But the better the tool you have the more you can take advantage of it to achieve better results. In this respects, the LX7 is a formidable tool, that gives the photographer most of the capabilities he or she might ever need. I am far from exhausting the possibilities that this gem of a camera provides and suspect that there are many that I will probably never use. I would give this camera a punctuation of 9.9 out of a possible 10 and highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.",2,2,0.020793766,0.082660235,0.896546
"I loved the easy setup of this mount.That said, the TV and situation I originally wanted to use this to mount was unsuited to this product.Because the back is nearly flush with the wall, you must ensure your power cable goes through the wall and is pre positioned along with the other cables.  And more importantly, it is not a good choice of mounts if you will need to be swapping cables/components in and out of the back panel a lot.  This is why we abandoned our original intended use for this mount.However, our second plan for the mount works fine, setting up TV mounted higher on a wall, with all the components down low, using 12' HDMI cables to connect the components to the TV through the wall.  Of course the fact that it doesn't angle down makes it a bit of a pain for high wall use, but the room is large enough where the viewing angle is manageable.

I was intrigued by the Onkyo for it's network jack and the wealth of digital  media that went with it.  So I ordered it.  When it arrived I went to hook up my external EQ to color the sound to my preference by connecting it to the tape monitor jacks.  Well I quickly discovered my EQ made no difference to the music because unlike my previous receiver with a mechanical tape monitor switch this was an electronic tape monitor that would not act as a processor loop to engage my EQ.  Bummer.  Mom always said when life gives you lemons, make lemonade!As I was packing up the receiver to return it I discovered the Onkyo had on the back a preamp and zone 2 low level outputs.  I read the manual and discovered that if I came off the zone 2 output I could run that through my EQ.  Fortunately I had a spare amp to receive the output off the EQ and then drive my speakers.  What is really cool is I can still use the Onkyo internal amp to run another pair of speakers which another reason why I bought the Onkyo to have an A and B set of speakers.  Then I downloaded the  Onkyo iPhone app.  This lets me individually control the volume of each set of speakers for the right amount of level control.  This is something I couldn't do utilizing the A and B on the Onkyo since the two pairs of speakers I use have different sensitivity levels.  I realize this configuration requires an additional amp but the sound is killer.  Picture the old advertisement for Maxell with the guy slouched down in his chair listening to his music.  That's me listening to all 4 speakers.  Yes people, just music.  No Dolby anything,  THX or anything to do with video.  Try turning off the TV and close your eyes.  Let the beauty of music paint an image in your mind.  Beautiful music is enchanting!",2,2,0.02889108,0.025900912,0.94520795

"Does your digicam give you 10x optical magnification? Do your binoculars store the images you are viewing?  Likely the answer is no to both questions.  Along comes the Bushnell 10 x 25 VGA Digital Camera Binocular.  Now it is quite possible to buy a high-power spotting scope and put your camera lens right on the viewfinder and snap the image. I first saw a demo in Costa Rica by a nature guide pointing out a huge iguana sunning on a log 50-60 ft from us.  But the spotting scope isn't nearly as portable. This binocu-camera combo does a reasonable job. The original software installed readily in my PC with Win XP Pro and those original software drivers work just fine. When it asks about the editing program, I simply asked it to use my Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0. and import the images after doing the transfer with no difficulty. Detailed editing proceeds normally.  Are these National Geographic images suitable for framing?  No way! Even with manual adjustments, you simply cannot correct them like a normal digicam shot. Colors are not true unfortunately. It's just a great little device for carrying in your backpack or pocket.  For the price, it's just fine. Don't expect mind-blowing images folks.  And don't forget to use a monopod to steady the device. It does NOT come with VR (vibration reduction). Telephoto shots are notoriously fuzzy because you simply can't hold the camera & lens that steady without VR built-in or something like a stump, tree, or monopod to make it rock-steady.  My Nikon VR telephoto lens does an outstanding job even hand-held so I know that it is feasible with the right equipment. Maybe Bushnell will come up with a VR feature in the future. 3.5-4.0 stars (good to very-good)",2,2,0.002353801,0.05513967,0.94250643

"A friend of mine broke his laptop screen, and we had to replace it.I'd suggest to look up some youtube videos on disassembling the laptop and replacing the screen to get a better idea of what you're dealing with.Suggestions for repair: ANY data cable should be handled with much caution. If they're the type of ribbon cable that you push out from the board USE PLASTIC TOOLS. Using a simple metal flat-head may work, but it is possible you could bend/cut a component. Also, make sure that all the connections are secure before re-assembly.

Compact and strong enough to support the weight of VESA 100 equipped monitors.

"This is my first iPod. I was one of those people that swore them off in the name of being different from all the kids walking around with ear buds on constantly. But eventually, the 8GB nano was given to me and it didn't take long to grow on me. It is nice to use when at the gym on the stationary bikes or elliptical. I also use it at work since my computer can't play audio. A docking station is also a nice complement to it to have at home.I've noticed one flaw (in mine - not sure if it's universal). Sometimes, inexplicably, the control circle will get extremely sensitive and the volume will go up and down for no reason. And of course it makes that annoying sound when the volume changes. Eventually the sensitivity goes away though. Doesn't happan to often but it does.The iPod has all sorts of features beyond audio but I haven't used them yet. The only one I can conceive of using is photos.Though I didn't have to pay for mine, the price listed is steep for only 8 gigs. It did not take long for me to fill mine up and then have to start eliminating stuff when I wanted to add more. The price is high enough to where I'm not sure I would buy another one if my current one broke.Overall, I have liked the product and it has been more to me than just a source of constant music to my ears.

"I won't repeat all of the very cool features that this gadget has - suffice it to say it does about everything imaginable.  To me, it's worth the price alone just to be able to stream Napster.  However - it is still pretty buggy, particularly when it comes to the alarm clock.  This is something that may not show up right away - mine worked fine for several weeks before it started to wig out.  As others have noted- the alarm will suddenly come on in the middle of the day for no reason.  Sometimes the snooze dialogue box doesn't appear so you basically have to go through the hassle of disabling your alarm when all you really want to be doing is catching 10 more minutes of zzzzs.  I've found that turning it off and starting it up again sometimes helps, though even that is buggy.  When you turn it off - it should stay off - but mine will sometimes immediately restart, as if I was rebooting a computer.  I have worked with their support and they've actually been great and very helpful.  I know they are working on these issues as they seem to release fairly regular firmware/software updates.

Concerning the adapter ring and filters getting stuck together.The problem is that when you grip the ring and filter and squeeze and turn trying to seperate them, the weaker plastic adapter ring distorts making it impossible to turn.  The solution is to place the two in the palms of both hands flat like your making a hamburger and twist both hands in opposite directions. It is amazing how easily they turn and come apart.

"Summary:  Except for the notable lack of a ""guest mode,"" this router does everything that I could want and more.  It has great speed and range, hasn't had any drops, and has a great interface.  The only question is the price - I'd recommend this most to people who are sure they need all the features.What's good:- This is very good, with dual band (2.4 and 5.0 ghz) and 5 gz AC networking.  On the other hand, if you don't have client devices that use the AC standard, or worse yet don't have 5.0 ghz devices, you're paying for a lot of features you won't use.- Performance has been very good, at least equal to the other routers I have tried.  I can get a good signal anywhere in my 2 story house, and an adequate signal in my yard, which is really all I need.- The unit is nice and compact.  I actually appreciate that there are only two LEDs, one to show that the router is connected to the internet and one to show that the wifi is up.  The array of blinking lights on other routers never managed to communicate any more than that, so I'm happier with two humble lights than 10 shouting ones.- The major selling point is ""Streamboost,"" a relatively smart priority system that is supposed to recognize which devices and applications need more bandwidth and prioritize those, without a lot of user configuration.  I confess that I'm not a power user, but I haven't had Netflix pause to buffer since I put this in, so within my limited needs, it seems to be an improvement.What could be better:- It's a drag not having ""guest mode"" - a second network that doesn't have access to the local LAN and gets lower priority.  With guest mode, people at my house can use a wifi connection without me sharing passwords.  According to the manufacturer, they left guest mode out to improve performance, but I would strongly prefer at least to have the option.Other than the lack of guest mode and the price, recommended.",2,2,0.0008159639,0.006029019,0.993155

"This weekend I picked up a Mac Mini (with the above mentioned specs..) after doing tons of research and truly looking at my overall needs.  Originally my thought was to pick up a Macbook but after focusing on my needs and seeking a cheaper alternative to jumping into the MAC arena I decided to go this route.  After being a PC user for many many years the thought of learning a new operating system seemed rather intimidating but having friends who have made the jump made the task seemed a bit less daunting..I spent many hours perusing You Tube for Mac reviews...everything from Macbook AIR..to PRO..to Macbook and eventually MINI.  There's a lot of good informative stuff out there!!  Also reading the reviews on this site and many other online reviews I felt I was armed with enough knowledge to finally visit an APPLE store and ask some intelligent questions.  Fortunately I ran into 2 young sales guys who knew their product well and tried to be as objective as possible about the product they were selling...I got the feeling they were truly interested in making sure I understood the differences between Windows Vista and Leopard and spent a  great deal of time showing me features in ilife and Leopard in general.  This made a difference to me in that the APPLE store staff exhibited such ""refreshing"" professionalism.  I think that in itself made a big difference in helping me make a decision to try APPLE products.  Their support was top notch compared to the experience I had received in the past from other vendors.After I picked up my Mac Mini...set up was a breeze.  I had a Dell 17"" 1703 monitor that was formerly coupled to my Dell Dimension 8300 that I hooked up to with no problems.  I had a made a decision to get the APPLE keyboard due to the Command features and the fact that I liked the way the keys felt and am glad.  Dell speakers and a Logitech wireless mouse completed the set up and I was off and running!  The OS booted up so quickly that I immediately thought I'll never be able to go back to VISTA again..LOL!  And setup was effortless..wireless..email..all very intutive and painless.  No wonder APPLE has so many people switching!Once everything was set up I was working within the OS within minutes and what's cool is on the APPLE website there are many informative video tutorials as well as written support that helps a lot.For video & pictures the OS recognized both my Sony digital & video cameras and I was able to download all my files seamlessly with iphoto and imovie.  Here is where I can see the advantages of having additional memory but generally it wasn't too much of an issue..I will eventually upgrade my memory in the near future..Overall for the weekend spent acclimating myself to this amazing little computer, the experience has been pretty darn good!  I still have much to learn and will follow up with a more detailed review further on down the road...But for first impressions I'm pretty happy!  The bottom line is...look at your computing needs and budget and work within those parameters.  You don't really need to pump out a couple of grand for an ideal APPLE experience..If you have a good monitor, keyboard and mouse..and are looking to change to the APPLE OS this would be the best and economical way to go!Updated 8-24-08Well after checking out some of my earlier reviews..I decided to update this one as I ended up bringing this Mac Mini back and returning it for a Macbook Pro.  My decision was mainly because of the lack of video quality due to anemic memory and no dedicated video card.  I ended up having to pay a restocking fee but I didn't mind it so much as I got what  really wanted!!My review of my Macbook Pro will come separately..",2,2,0.0029481682,0.003215783,0.9938361

"I bought this hoping it would do CEC.  I expected it to do that since I've seen reviews on other dual-core android mini PCs that did work with CEC.  And this device says it is HDMI v1.4 compliant.  If that were true it would work with CEC, but it does not.  CEC lets you control the device with your TV remote, and that is really what I wanted, to be able to use one remote to turn on the TV and to control my multimedia player application.  So it loses a star for that.Also, because it only has one USB port, it is impossible to plug in both a keyboard and mouse out of the box, and it is impossible to use some apps on this device without both a keyboard and mouse, or without a touchscreen, which TVs usually are not.  I'm going to end up having to order a bluetooth wireless keyboard/mouse combo to use this device.  So add another $30 and the inability to use the device with just my one TV remote.So that's all the bad...  but there are a lot of good things about this.  It will convert your TV into an android device like a tablet, and you can load up all the same apps from the Play Store.  I don't have much need for a tablet, but this is much cheaper than buying one.  Also the TV I'm using this with is not a smart TV, so now I can get e-mails and browse the web and use facebook, ect...  I love that it plugs directly into HDMI and hides behind my TV and is powered by my TV's USB port, so when I turn off the TV this device also powers off.  I also love that I do not need to maintain a PC attached to this TV and I don't need to run wires to that room.So for all the good things it does well, I think I'll keep it.  It is not slow compared to my Galaxy S4 and is essentially the same device with an android OS.I'm just disappointed that it doesn't work with CEC as it should have.Also, it does a great job streaming small media files over Wireless-N, however, if you're TV is not in the same room as your access point, you will not be able to stream 12GB 1080P MKV files very well at full bandwidth...  It kinda works, but it will pause occasionally.  I suppose that's okay for me because if I was going to watch something of that quality I'd watch it in my living room, and if I really wanted to I could download that file locally to the microSD card.  The TV I'm using with this device is more often used to watch smaller videos of lower quality, so I guess it'll be fine.

"This weather-proof, wireless speaker is an easy and cheap solution for those seeking music outside their home.

If you purchase 2, then you would move one switch to ""L"" and one to ""R"".  There is a bass boost button which can be used for most music, but has to be turned off for bass-heavy music (due to significant distortion). There is a noticeable decrease in loudness when using batteries, but still should be plenty loud for most settings.Pros:- Weatherproof (Rain; strong winds)- Battery or AC powered (expect 12 hours using 6 AA rechargeable batteries)- Loud enough for patio/pool areas.Cons:- No off button for transmitter (either must unplug it or use a power strip)",2,2,0.0030066113,0.057932977,0.93906045

"My only complaint (to get it out of the way) is the IMON software and display. The display is just bright and useless (in my opinion), so I wouldn't get it just for that.

The remote also is useless and I had to get a uv usb for a remote anyway for my machine.The pros (that outweigh the cons, for me): EASY build. I love how it's set up! It is a little cramped getting in the motherboard, but took me a second longer than previous builds. The way it's set up is the compartments separate heat a bit, which is definitely helpful for me now. We just bought a new entertainment stand and the fans are a little closer to the side than I like, but it's doing great because of the heat dispersal and separated units inside.

"Love is not a word that I like to use for inanimate objects but I love this remote. I have a Harmony 520 remote which costs over $150. This one costs $21 and it is BETTER.The buttons are bigger and easier to see and press. The programming is simple and it covers all of my components. It has volume punch through and total system off/on.I have a large screen Samsung TV, Samsung Smart Hub Blu-ray DVD player and a Sony AV receiver. I don't have cable hooked up to my ""man cave"" TV but it would easily handle it if I did. Setup was a breeze and it did all that I wanted which was:1. Control everything without me having to switch component buttons.2. The volume punch thru allows the vol and mute buttons to control the AV receiver which is where all of the sound comes from. I don't use the TV speakers for sound.3. The system ON/OFF allows a one button push to turn everything on or off in sequence but with only one button press.I use the DVD player to stream Netflix, play movies in MP4 format from an external harddrive, play DVDs and stream Pandora or Hulu. I purposefully did not connect cable to this TV system but it would easily handle it. All of the content comes from the DVD player so the only control that I need for the TV is off/on and all I need from the AV receiver is vol control. Most will of course have TV channels but mine is purely a movie or streaming system. The cable TVs are upstairs. Therefore all the buttons that I need are accessible without pressing any component buttons. It stays on DVD.Some universal remotes don't handle an AV receiver. The Harmony 520 is good but not as good as this and definitely not as good for almost ten times the price. I simply like this remote better.Push the light button located at the bottom and the remote keys light up a bright red. You can program macro functions up to 20 steps but I don't use that but it's there if I want to.

"I wanted a compact camera that I could carry with me when my DSLR was just too big. The P7100 fit the bill perfectly. Pictures in most conditions have been excellent. Battery life superb. Great rear LCD display. Versatile controls. Very effective vibration reduction. Good lens quality backed by in-camera distortion and chromatic aberration correction (when you use JPEG output). It accepts (and communicates with) Nikon flash units. Seemingly sturdy construction.I've also found it to be a good indoor snapshot camera. I wasn't really expecting that. I'll grab it over my DSLR for shots of family and friends indoors.Now with that said, I will list the negatives. Keep in mind that my regular camera is a D300s and the downsides tend to apply on most, maybe all compact cameras.1. I wanted a versatile camera. However use of many features preclude the use of others. For instance I can't use the intervalometer when I'm shooting RAW. Why? There are many such restrictions.2. Manual focusing is pretty much a joke, and the limited range of aperture sizes reduce the flexibility of Shutter priority mode.3. Viewfinder only gives you a general idea of your frame.4. Camera is too slow for action photography. Luckily I'm primarily a landscape photographer.5. Camera does poor job shooting toward the sun (not at the sun, just toward it).I've taken about 1,000 pictures with it so far and am very happy with my decision. The Canon G12 was also on my short list. They are very similar except for the lens (Nikon is better) and JPEG processing (Canon is better).",2,2,0.0007573326,0.005155048,0.9940876

"If I could marry it and have its baby, I would.  Seriously.  I am a professional software engineer who works full-time out of my home.  Most of the time I work using wired ethernet, but my kids and wife have a lot of WiFi devices, so having a reliable WiFi network is important.  The house is a one story ranch that is very long, with lots of walls that are in the way from one end to the other.  In the past I've used two Linksys routers for full coverage (and have used two different models).  Both Linksys models had egregious firmware bugs that Linksys never bothered to fix (others complained about them on Linksys forums, so it was not just me).  They were not minor annoyances -- with one of the routers any wired computer could *never* reach a wifi computer.  With the other, the parental controls/filters did absolutely nothing -- it was as though they did not exist.  I'm pointing these things out here because its apparent that Asus does fix its bugs.  Asus has bothered to respond to other people's reviews on this website, pointing out how to download and install new firmware that resolves whatever bugs they've encountered.  Linksys never bothered to respond to these complaints on their own forums, let alone Amazon's.My router arrived last week (5/4/2012), and the firmware that was on it was close to ~ 3.0.0.3.100 (I don't recall exactly), but it was higher than the version about which some others have had difficulties.  I upgraded it to the latest, 3.0.0.3.112.  I have now tested it quite thoroughly and have not encountered any significant problems.  I found its U.I. to be a little flaky with Firefox, but the problems vanished with Internet Explorer.Its power on both 2.4 ghz and 5.0 ghz at 80 milli watts is sufficient to cover the entire house, from end to end, which is a first for this house.  There is an adjustment in the firmware that allows for increasing the amount of power the router uses to broadcast its signals, which is something I have not seen on other residential routers.Overall, the user interface is nicely organized, and generally responds very quickly (I can't say the same for my old Linksys routers).I downloaded a lan speed test that measures how quickly a computer can copy a file to another computer over the Lan.  Using Wireless N at 5 ghz / 40 mhz, I consistently get right around 85 to 90 mbps, which totally rocks for WiFi. Wireless G was consistently at the high end of the G spec -- low to mid 50's.  It wasn't that long ago that I was excited about having a 100 mbps ethernet switch, and at that time I did not think I would be getting similar speeds over WiFi.It has too many features to list, many of which are going to be present in most all residential routers, and some of which are only in higher-end models like this one.  Some of the features that impressed me:* I tested its DDNS by registering a domain with asuscomm (which they give you for free!), and setup a secure VPN.  It works!* USB support for various add-ons, like sharing a disk drive, ITunes server, Print Server, and WiMax.* Black-box support for using it as an additional access point that talks to another router over ethernet.  I know you can do this with other routers, but the setup is not obvious.* Black-box support for using it to create a wireless bridge, from one access point to another (I once had Netgear router that claimed to be able to do this but it did not work.  I have not tested this feature with this router, but I assume it does work).",2,2,0.0034953747,0.010901833,0.98560274

"EDITED: 8/12/09 - Original Review at the bottomWent for a hard 40-minute run on a treadmill this morning and was sweating profusely.  I guess my sweat finally found its way into the controls after several weeks of owning these.  I can no longer power off my headphones and as soon as I turned off my Bluetooth receiver on my iPhone, the headphones went dead.  Now I can't turn it on or off and charging it does nothing.  Going to have to call Motorola to get it replaced.=============ORIGINAL REVIEW=============================================================I mainly need these for exercising and rarely use it for talking on the phone.  Let's just put it this way, I only use them for exercising and will occasionally get a phone call while using them.  So my most important requirement is that these are sweat proof.  I am training for a marathon so you can imagine how long my running workouts are and I sweat like crazy.  My previous set of wired headphones were Sony padded, over-the-ear one-piece headphones that fit behind your ears.  Those worked EXCELLENT and were pretty comfortable for anything up to an hour.  After that, the band behind the ears would get a little irritating but that's normal for behind-the-ear headphones.  The Motorola S305 is no different.I've only had the S305 for about a week but I've managed to do several hour long workouts with them and made sure I was sweating heavily.  No problems yet!  My previous set of Bluetooth headphones were the Motorola S9-HD and although people said this was more sweat proof than the Motorola S9, I still managed to short out the volume control buttons from sweat.  The design just doesn't work because they are earbud style so I knew I needed something like my old wired headphones (i.e. padded over-the-ear and behind-the-ear).I came across these on Motorola's web site and decided to get them through Amazon.  The build quality seems a little cheap but that could be because they are super light and the band that wraps around the back of the your head is very thin.  So, the pieces that go over your ears sort of dangle around a bit.  Not sure why Motorola made the band so flimsy.  I loved the feel of the S9-HD because the Bluetooth transmitter was on the band behind your head.  The S9-HD was very sturdy and felt solid compared to the S305.  But I'd give that up for something sweatproof anyday!  So, the S305 has performed awesome despite my sweat.  Because of the design, no sweat (or very little) gets on anything other than the pads.  So everything else stays dry and things are working happily.  No shorts.LOVE THEM!

"I cannot speak highly enough of this enclosure. I bought it along with a WD 2.5"" drive for the express purpose of using it to house the new drive so I could clone my Mac drive (pre-unibody MacBook Pro), and replace it with the new hard drive.The external casing is a single piece of aluminum (not two pieces held, clam-like). The inside slides out to reveal a board which you then screw the hard drive onto with 4 screws. Once attached, the inside slides into the single-piece aluminum outer casing (along a 'rail' inside the case) and is secured by two screws at one end. Connection to the computer is via a cable (supplied) which has a mini-usb connector at one end and two standard USB connectors, one half way along the cable and the 2nd at the other end (the cable has two standard USB connectors to ensure that if your machine is unable to power the drive with one connector, you can plug the 2nd connector into another USB port to provide additional power).The drive powered up first time with no trouble. I ran the cloning program on my Mac and then removed the new drive from the enclosure. I then opened the Mac and put the new, cloned drive inside. Everything worked perfectly!I then put the old Mac drive into the enclosure. That worked first time too! I now have the old Mac drive running in the enclosure.This enclosure is solidly built, attractive, small, efficient and excellent value. I can't speak for the instruction manual as I didn't even open the plastic bag it came in!Other enclosures I have purchased over the years have not held the drive on a board, rather they have allowed the drive to 'rattle' around inside, connected at one end via a flimsy cable.

"I've never been able to find any mouse type equipment that can compare with the Marble Mouse.  No mouse, keypad, or finger tip joystick can compare with it (though the joystick was second).  I originally got one years ago because of developing carpal tunnel.  That ended immediately when I started using the Marble Mouse. A few years later, I started using the ""wireless"" Marble Mouse, but found it had two problems (the profile is too high and my wrist was uncomfortable and it STILL has a wire for the transmitter! -- lot of help that is) so I gave it away and went back to the Marble Mouse. (The guy who got the wireless loves it, but he has much larger and longer hands than I do.)  I just purchased a second Marble Mouse ""just in case"" -- tested that it function, but it's still in the box.  I don't think it is being manufactured any longer, trackball devices appear to be on the decline, and I can't imagine trying to use any other ""mouse"" device so I wanted to be sure to have one.

"I installed this in my '90 Miata. It was easy to install and it sounds great, especially with the Amp that I added on. It's got some nice presets for EQ and if the presets don't work for you you can program custom ones.- the ipod connection works (no ipad support), but I've decided not to use it since the only way to navigate is using the deck, and with a two line display with big characters, that's quite miserable. I'd much rather use my ipod for navigation.- I've settled on USB. I have a 16gb USB stick that I regularly update and just leave in the car. It's much easier to deal with the USB filesystem than the iPod. I'd get a smaller USB, since if you had 16gb of music on it, it would be a lot to navigate.- lots of success with the bluetooth, even with the top down on the convertible. Works great with my blackberry. If you have an iPhone the streaming from the device works nice and then you can use the iphone interface to navigate music. (have not tried iOS 4)- the headline for this device on Amazon mentions AAC support. THERE IS NO ACC support unless you use an iPod.

"Initially, it made perfect sense to create a video review for Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus (PS17+) video editor. However, an important feature, and one that led to some very negative reviews, is knowing what computer to install it on so it makes more sense to write a review and post a video example on YouTube. So that's what I did. (You can see the PS17+ edited video here: http://youtu.be/5kb2cCYFa44)On the side of the box, using a magnifying glass, you can see that it requires the following:1. Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista (SP2) (OS 64 Recommended)2. Intel Core Duo 1.8 Ghz Core i3 or AMD Athlon 64 3800 + 2GHz or higher3. 2GB RAM or higher  4GB RAM with Windows 64There's other information but that's enough for getting the minimum. My old Dell Vostro 1500 runs on Windows 7, has 2GB of RAM and has a 64K OS--I needed the 64K for a streaming media server I run on my Dell; so I was certain of that.  I installed PS17+, but before I did, I removed all other videos. (Other reviews indicated it took too long because it was gathering up other videos.) It does take a loooong time to install; so just go watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy after install starts. When the install finished I started it up and the first thing I did was to try out the built-in Web cam media import. It worked fine, but then I went to edit it, and it crashed. So I re-read the hardware requirements, and my computer just wasn't big enough:1. I had an Intel Core2 Duo CPU, but I only had a 1.6 GHz processor. (It requires 1.8GHz)2. I had 2GB of RAM, but for a 64-bit OS, it requires 4GB.My advice is to make double-certain that your PC is big enough before purchase and install. Corel needs to make the system requirements big enough to read without a magnifying glass. (Seriously!).Central Coast Drone Video located in Carmel, California (on the opposite coast from Connecticut) was helping out on this review, and they installed it on a new PC running on an AMD A85550m Quad Core processor with 2.1GHz, 8GH RAM. The install took a long time, but the program ran without a hitch. (They store their videos on a terabyte external drive.) The company makes ariel videos, and all of their videos have a loud prop noise and sometimes stabilization issues that need ironing out. Since PS17+ has stabilizing features, their raw videos would be a good test of the editor.For some reason, PS17+ decided to start working again on my anemic PC, and I wanted to test its ability to use a built-in webcam for making online educational videos, a project I happen to be currently involved with. With my crummy built-in camera and mic, I was able to create and edit movies easily. The key word here is ""easily."" In working with university faculty, you want to have an easy-to-use system. They've got enough to do with research, publishing, and classes without adding appointments for making videos in a studio. Better to have a simple way that gets the job done using a webcam than a studio with perfect lighting and high quality cameras that never gets done. Besides, the webcams are getting better all the time--especially those HD cameras built into iPad and Surface tablets.Another feature is the ability to use PS17+ with Pinnacle Studio for the iPad (an iPad is displayed on the cover of the PS17+ box) Ok, reality check here: PS17+ is made only for Windows--there's no Mac PS17+--but there is an iPad version of Pinnacle Studio. So I bought the iPad Pinnacle Studio app ($12.99 from the App Store) and installed it. Now I didn't have to use the crummy webcam and mic in my old PC, but I could use the HD camera in my iPad. It took about 5 minutes to figure out PS for the iPad, and so I made a talking head video, edited it and put a title on it and saved it to the same location on the iPad where all of my photos/videos get saved--it's in the iPad Camera app. I ported it over to my iMac, and then put it on a flash drive and plugged it into my PC. It imported lickety-split into PS17+. I then added music to the title, added raw ariel footage from Central Coast Drone Video, split the audio from the video and replaced it first with sound effect (seagulls) and then with music. There is a nice set of both sound effects and music. (You can see the whole project on YouTube: http://youtu.be/5kb2cCYFa44There are a huge number of features in PS17+, but it is very easy to get started with. I've done video editing extensively with Adobe Premiere (almost $800)  and Adobe Premiere Elements (about the same price as PS17+) and even a bit with some of the other video editors on both the PC and Mac; so what I may think of as ""easy"" may not be to some with no video editing experience. However, if you have video you want to edit, you just load it into PS17+ by dragging it into the Navigation window and then dragging it to the timeline. You use a razor icon (looking like a little rectangle)  to clip the video at the playhead. Click on the part you want to get rid of, and click on a trash can.  You are now a video editor.The documentation is almost 400 pages long in a PDF file. You can find pretty much what you want using the Search window (or read it from cover to cover if you're so inclined). However, you cannot find ""Live Screen Capture"" -- one of the new features in PS17+ plastered on the box. It turns out that Screen Capture in a separate application you have to go fishing for in the folders in the Pinnacle folders in your system. I mention this fact because in online courses, Screen Capture is very important because you can display images and text--or computer programming IDEs and explain how to work with them. It's there, yes; so it needs documenting.One of the best features I found in PS17+ is the fast rendering. If you don't like sitting around twittling your thumbs while your edited movie renders, you'll like this. Also, rather than setting everything up as an AVI file, I'd strongly recommend MPEG. They're smaller, and you can upload them to YouTube as well as put them on a DVD. Online you can find plenty of ""How To"" videos about using all of the features in PS17+.Finally, I'm not sure why there isn't a Mac version of this program. The iPad version is a mere whisper of the functionality in PS17+, but it's a good start. As for recommending this, just remember, get the biggest PC you can afford with the fastest processor and the most RAM.

"NEW UPDATE on inside antenna I purchase} This antenna is a disappointment. It never came in with the signal amplifier as shown in box and mentioned as a selling point. That's what I wrote when i received and it was missing the antenna adapter for better reception. I complaint to the vendor and ask if it could just be ship to me instead of me returning the whole thing. They were courteous, understanding and FAST. Received real fast and I have it working with the antenna. Feels it makes a difference with the reception.As with the antenna it self it will do it's job and it will do it well, but no miracles. It all depends on the signals you are getting from the TV stations.  Im disappointed that living between Manhattan and NJ (No I don't live in the Hudson) I don't get more signals. I expected some I don't get and get other I wasn't expecting. For an inside antenna it's worth the money and the best is it doesn't look like an antenna, so you can put it anywhere you are  getting a better reception.",2,0,0.60551184,0.33100525,0.06348288

"Ordered a refurbished copy of this lens and was blown away by the pictures it produced. Good quality wide open, and stellar past f/4. Would buy again. My only gripe = plasticky, outdated, ""third-party-lens"" feel. Although constructed well; it just doesn't have that professional feel, and for the price that's a non-issue. However, my Sigma 17-70 had a aluminum barrel and it inspired a little more confidence than this lens...however the Tamron blew it out of the water with the image quality and constant aperture.You won't be disappointed in this lens.

"This is a nice, sharp looking little camera. It is very easy to set up and to mount wherever you'd like. Products always are ranked better with me when I have no issues with set up! It is an indoor camera, so I've got mine set up in the living room and have been trying it out while I'm at work. Thought it would be fun to see how often the dog sneaks up on the couch. He does, and it sends me an e-mail alert every time he walks into the living room. The sensitivity is pretty crazy- his tail will barely enter the shot and I'll get an e-mail notification. Or if the air conditioning kicks on and it makes the curtain move a wee bit, I'll get a notification. This is both awesome that it works so well and a little annoying. The audio both in and out works better than I expected and it has a great, clear picture with a wider span of the room than I had anticipated.

"I have had a tomtom XL for years and it always worked flawlessly. I decided to upgrade for free lifetime maps and traffic. When I turned the unit on, it asked me to connect to my computer for updates. I did so and about 90 minutes later, it was ready to go. Or so I thought. It couldn't find my destination although my XL found it quickly. The START 55TM kept sending me around my block. I was finally able to plan a route by canceling the route in the unit. I took it with me on a 50 mile trip and it seemed OK at first. After about 15 miles the unit began to stutter. I was so startled that I began to laugh and almost became a statistic. When I got near my destination, it sent me to the wrong road and I had to ask for directions from a passerby.On the way back it ceased stuttering but the unit repeated all the directions twice. Then I noticed the map had flipped so the arrow representing the car always pointed toward me, easy to solve, I turned the unit upside down and made it home with no trouble. It left the task bar hard to read, though. I also could not get the traffic to activate even in a town or on an interstate. The manual suggested I needed an accessory. Support suggested that I did not. A further frustration was the lack of documentation. No instructions at all. The manual was slightly less helpful than not reading it at all because the content is muddled and confusing at best. The ""manual"" contains generalities and possibilities with few specifics so reading it is a waste of time.Too bad. I liked my other tomtom. I don't know what could have happened that the product deteriorated so. Unfortunately for me, my wife has taken possession of the XL, so I can't get it back.The only bright spot is that Melecia, at customer service is sharp and efficient. She answered my questions and gave me helpful information. She worked with me professionally, and politely to solve my situation.Tomtom, please take notice.Update 6/24/2013Made several calls to Tomtom support and Enid and April (at Tomtom support) appear to have straightened out the problems. I took two short trips and the unit worked well. So, to be fair, I have raised my rating to four stars only because it seems a little slow in picking up satellites and because it seems to have a tendency to revert to the route planning screen. A touch brings it back to ""normal"". I deliberately chose a different route than the unit had provided and there was a little confusion before it straightened itself out. During that time the unit kept insisting that I make a U-turn even though I was only a mile from my destination. When I used the POI to set a destination it also told me I had arrived even though I was still about a quarter mile away from my destination. The traffic feature appears to be working but I will need to test it on a longer trip. All in all, not a bad deal for the price. There are a lot of features packed into the unit. It also gives you a lot of information. Through use of the overlays you can obtain even more information about a needed destination quickly. One thing is a must. Create a account with Tomtom home. Create a back up and update it. That may save a lot of grief down the road. Demonstrations of features are also available from the home page.Update 7/7/13Just returned from Gettysburg. The way out of the reenactment battlefield was blocked off by police. The START 55 took me around the blocked off areas, through developments, little used roads and back roads until it got me back to the main highway. It even picked out a restaurant that turned out to be both good and inexpensive. I warned me of traffic problems 6 to 7 miles ahead and indicated whether or not I needed to pick an alternate route. I'm impressed...... Gave my old TOMTOM (XL335)  to my wife. It still works flawlessly after almost 10 years. I only gave it a 4 star rating because it mispronounces the names of some roads and there is no way to ""lock"" the unit. Another GREAT DEAL from TOMTOM and AMAZON. Another tip of the hat to Amazon customer service who straightened the unit and me out.",2,0,0.44704357,0.31890136,0.23405512

"I love this miniature tripod. It is a lightweight, but rock solid, means of support for anyone using a compact digital camera, and maybe even for those who are willing to use it with such relatively ""compact"" film cameras like the Leica M6 and Contax G2 rangefinder cameras. I've tested this tripod with both a Leica M6 and Contax G2, and though it will not support both a camera and lens in its rigid tripod stance, its tripod legs are flexible and easily adjustable, and so, therefore, it can still be use as a means of offering more support with these cameras, especially for anyone thinking of taking pictures at a shutter speed as low as 1/15 of a second. You can rest the tripod against one's body, the front of a car, a rock or any other solid surface, and still use it as a means of support to allow users to take pictures at relatively low shutter speeds. An especially useful feature is the sliding tripod mount, which mounts to the tripod base of a camera; in plain English, users don't need to attach the entire tripod to the camera while they are in the midst of trying to attach the tripod to the camera itself.",2,2,0.00035324343,0.0014915357,0.9981552

"I'm enjoying this little computer in my hotel room right now, hooked up to the TV via the HDMI port and with a wireless keyboard/touchpad combination. If you'd normally use a laptop this way you can cut your travel load considerably. The processor seems to be quite fast, and a video replay on WatchESPN was very smooth on this big screen (50"" ?) Samsung TV. Page load times with the default browser are slow, but this is an Android ICS issue (I have an Android tablet that does the same thing) and hopefully will be sorted out with an update. One other minor issue is that the touchpad keyboard still pops up when you're using a physical one. Installing a free ""null keyboard"" from the Google Play Store solves that problem. I don't understand what a previous reviewer meant by using Android with a keyboard and pointing device ""feeling wrong"" (were his/her objections physical or moral?). But it's easy to swipe with this keyboard (Logitech K400) by holding down the left button and simply swiping the touchpad. This little marvel has everything you need to surf the Web, check e-mail, and has enough capacity to download whatever apps you may need (especially with an SD card that you can offload your installed apps to).

Got this as a back-up to the OEM Canon battery. You know how it is Mr Murphy would only show up when you are trying to capture Christmas or the Grand kids birthday party.So far it seems to have about as good a battery life as the original and while I have not tried the car charger out I don't see where I would use it except for a total emergency. I mean having one battery in the camera and one in the gadget bag would give you over a thousand shots away from an AC outlet so you would have to be doing some serious shooting in one day to warrant it's use but you never know. With that being said we had one for a Nikon Cool-Pix battery back-up that came in very handy on a vacation; of course the battery in a Cool-Pix does not have the life the Canon DLSR battery does.Do not have any problems with it fitting the camera or Canon charger.With the price for the battery and the charger about half what it would cost for an OEM battery you have a back-up charger in the event the OEM one fails.Recommended.,2,2,0.0012773003,0.014834285,0.9838884
"I purchased this product on the strength of Amazon reviews and was therefore not pleased to find in the product literature a solicitation for the company's Amazon review incentive program. You can apply to receive free products to test and **KEEP** by writing an Amazon review of one of the company's products and submitting the review and your Amazon order number. I'm giving the screen protector four stars (minus one big star for difficulty of application), but I would have viewed the glowing recommendations with a more jaundiced eye had I known of the incentive program (which I am obviously not applying for!) I don't know how the company decides which reviewers to accept into the program, but I can't see how offering a potential reward before the review is written doesn't skew results.I put the screen protector on last night, so can't yet speak to durability. It looks good in that it doesn't interfere with a good view of the screen. The price was very reasonable for a package of three. The stickers for dust removal are better than scotch tape b/c they're stiffer and easier to handle. I have applied many screen protectors to various devices and I did watch the instructional video, but I thought this one was relatively difficult to apply because it has a protective film you're supposed to discard on both the front and the back of the actual protector. The last step is to remove the top film, but because the top film adheres pretty tightly to the actual protector, the actual protector came off with the top film, undoing all my hard work getting the protector on the screen minus dust and air bubbles. And once that happened, it was impossible to determine whether the gazillion new air bubbles were between the disposable film and the protector or between the protector and the device. Ultimately I ended up bagging the top film, applying tape directly to the protector and dropping it back down using the tape as a handle - and painstakingly removing all the dust that had worked its way under the protector when it came off with the top film. It took a very long time and I'm going to live with two tiny defects that could not be worked out. Now that I really understand how the installation works, I will be much more careful when I remove the top disposable film.",2,1,0.1730672,0.66625696,0.16067588

"I've gone through a lot of chargers over the years of having smartphones and tablets. I've tried making do with the off-brand chargers that you can get cheap at Amazon or from Five Below. They claim to be rated for 2.1 A, so it seems like they should work as well as the charger that came with my device. And while they will charge a phone or a tablet, they can't seem to do both simultaneously. You only get so much juice out of those cheap knock-offs. Plus, they may not always fit where you want to plug them.This charger solves all of those problems. I have a widget installed that tells me how long it will take to charge my Galaxy S4. I plugged it into this charger and it told me 3 hours, 3 minutes. I plugged it into the Samsung charger and it told me 3 hours, 3 minutes. Then I put it back into this charger, but also added my Galaxy Note 8. It still said 3 hours, 3 minutes. In other words, there was plenty of juice to charge both devices with no drop-off.The rotating prongs are very handy. They don't lock particularly well when rotated, but if you have it wedged in a power strip it won't really matter. The prongs also fold down for easy transport.We are getting ready to take a trip and I normally have to take a bunch of chargers to keep all the family's electronics filled up. Although this charger won't take care of 2 smartphones, 2 tablets, and a Nintendo DS by itself, I am glad that it will let me leave a couple of the chargers at home.Of course, you can get 2 chargers at Five Below for 1/3 the cost of this charger.

"I needed to replace my 30 year old Targus tripod so I first bought another TargusTargus Digital TG-6660TR 66-Inch Tripod with 3-Way Panheadbelieving the quality would be the same. It wasn't and one of the leg supports broke away from the center post during the first use. At $35 with decent reviews I hoped for more. So the search was on for a quality tripod that wouldn't break the bank. I looked in every brick and mortar store I could find and all the major photography websites, Adorama, B&H;, Beach Camera....but I was learning that high quality = high $$$. Then I found this gem on Amazon for $65. I checked reviews on a few websites and the only real negative was the weight. Since the Targus I've been lugging around for 30 years was relatively heavy, that wasn't enough to dissuade me so I ordered it. The reviews are correct, it's heavy at just over 7 lbs. But it is extremely well made and the movement of the head in all positions is smooth as silk. It has a maximum height of 77 inches so it is a full foot taller than my old tripod. But height is worthless unless the tripod remains stable at whatever height you are using. No one wants to have their dslr and lens crashing because of a flimsy tripod. And I was using it for my new Canon 6D and 24-105 L lens. Together they are much heavier than my old T2i. This tripod is very stable, even fully extended and I have no fear of this tripod falling over with my equipment mounted. The two handles on the head are removable for storage and are large enough to easily find and adjust the camera. The size of the grips make tightening and loosening the head quick and effortless. It comes with a fairly heavy storage bag with a smaller side pocket for storage of the handles if you want to remove them plus any other small items you want to stow away. The legs are padded at the top which makes adjusting the tripod's footing sure and easy. I really don't have anything negative to say about this tripod except it is heavy. I don't mind the weight because I was used to toting a heavy tripod with me. If you are looking for something really light weight, consider carbon fiber or something cheap plastic with some thin walled aluminum support structure. If you want sturdy with excellent range (height)and smooth head movement this is an excellent choice. If it were a little lighter I would have given it 5 stars, otherwise it's a 5 star product.",2,2,0.02760486,0.021040829,0.9513544
"We received three items, as illustrated:  1) screen protector  2) stylus  3) protective case.  As others had cautioned we found the hole in the screen protector for the camera lens to be be small and off-location but a few minutes with a sharp knife tip easily enlarged the hole (best to check and do this BEFORE applying the protector).  Otherwise the screen protector went on easily and the two halves of the plastic inner case snapped securely together.  The rubber outer cover fit pretty well (perhaps a little loose over the power plug area) and the stylus works fine.  All together, fully functional and a great value.",2,2,0.0005675991,0.0018697514,0.99756265
"I will state up front that I might have been better off with a CF model, or something like a Gitzo or another solid brand, but I don't use a tripod a lot, so I settled for the aluminum (and the 488RC2 ballhead.)  Overall, it's a good deal.  I liked the center post option to go sideways, but find that I use it far less frequently than I would have expected.  It's light enough, offers enough flexibility for most photographic endeavors, and is a fraction of the cost of carbon fiber.  But this is more of a beginners tripod (and I don't mean that with any sarcasm whatsoever.)  I bought it, I use it infrequently, and it works for a large number of photographers based on sales and forum chatter.  But were I to begin using a tripod more often, I believe the aluminum adds a small degree of vibration and is less steady than a CF-comparable model - hence the ""beginner-status"" title.  One thing I never do is raise the center post.  That's one of the primary reasons I chose the 055XPROB - it's tall enough for a 6' person w/o extending the column.

"As far as the hard drive itself goes, what other reviewers have said about it is spot on. I was in a different category than they were. I didn't want to use this drive as my main one, but rather as a back-up for larger files for my Desktop. And I am not that skilled in knowing how to do this. So when I got it there were some things missing that I wished were in the box, like a SATA data cable, and an instruction book. All I got was the drive itself with a letter telling me about tech support and a site where I could download the software to clone my existing hard drive. So I called tech support three times. The first time he didn't understand what I was describing, and neither did the tech for my second call. A Radio Shack guy did help me though, and I got the right cable. When I called the third time with the cable attached the tech guy helped me get everything straight and it runs nicely.It took an amateur like me some effort that an instruction book with pictures of the needed cable could have helped save me time, and where I could read how to install it. So I give it four stars just because of the time it requires for me to get it going. Other than this I may make it my primary hard drive before too long, who knows? I like it.",2,0,0.42998233,0.36401904,0.20599869

"I have the black leather case. This case has a lot going for it --* It fits well and protects all the corners.* It closes easily and puts the device to sleep when closed.* It works well as a stand or just to hold it.* It looks good.* You can hold it in any orientation and it will be fine.My only complaints are:* The transition from the leather to the cloth interior is a bit ragged. Not too unsightly, but it could be smoother.* If you plug it in to charge when the case is closed, you can't open the case without putting pressure on the charging cable -- i.e. you are stuck waiting until it fully charges.* Conversely, if you plug it in to charge while the case is open you can't close the case. Also, you can charge it while it's being used as a stand.So I'm knocking down the star for my minor complaints, but really for the price and how nice it looks, I would buy it again.

Ok here goes a true laymens review - opened diamond hardened plastic package to reveal some good looking buds with a 45 degree tip where they go in your ears - this works well dont sweat that. the cord feels weird like red licorice..very cool and flexible but not slimy. The cans are not too huge but one look and you know something good is about to happen. ... the meat: My first tune was a 320kbps mp3 of Dire Straits &#34;Ride across the River&#34; - Im listening as the song starts to get going and WHAM! a drop kick bass drum that i though was going to suck the air out of my lungs ... you know the sound.. im sure you have a buddy with one of &#34;those&#34; car stereos...not the crappy loud one but fine quality one. - these are heavy with the bass so slide down the 125hz and just a touch 60hz and the mud with clear. amazingly enough even without touching settings the bass did not distort the mids or highs.. For those on the fence looking at those Bose or other insane price hype.. do yourself a favor and get these... youll thank me later.,2,2,0.065005824,0.12168804,0.8133062

"Bought this remote (along with the Logitech ""RF Wireless Extender"" kitLogitech Harmony RF Wireless Extender) for use with a Windows 7 64-bit based MCE Media Center. It works beautifully. Compared to something like a Philips Pronto remote, the Logitech setup process is ultra easy. Install the Logitech software, connect the remote via USB, walk through the setup wizard, and you're good to go.The (optional - I linked to it above) RF wireless extender lets you control equipment that's not within line of sight to the remote, such as equipment that's located in a media closet. I was a bit confused at first, because I wasn't sure if I needed the RF wireless system from logitech, or the RF Extender. Turns out the Harmony 1100 has the RF transmitter built in, so you only need the receiver to make it work, so the extender is all you need for RF control.Only nuisance is that Logitech's pre-defined template for a Microsoft Windows Media Center PC doesn't include a green MCE button. Thankfully I had an old infra red Microsoft MCE remote laying around, and had the Harmony 1100 ""learn"" the green button IR code, and added it to the template myself. Worked out ok for me, but if I hadn't had the old remote laying around, it would be difficult / annoying to control an MCE box without a green button-enabled remote.Range is excellent, and responsiveness is pretty good. It's not quite as fast as line-of-sight infra red, but it's totally usable and only slightly slower.I was also able to program in my favorite channels. Logitech doesn't include network logo icons, but you can download really nice ones from the web (iconharmony dot com).I was worried about the size of this remote, and thought I would miss a more traditional form factor, but honestly it's just fine.

"This is a great little travel router that works in several modes:- as a regular wireless router (but why would you use it that way?)- as a wireless bridge to connect devices that only have an ethernet port to a wireless network- to extend an existing wireless signal (repeater)- in so called WISP mode to enable your own hotspotThat last mode, WISP, is the one I find the most useful and I use it all the time when I'm traveling.

"Update 11/4/2003: Garmin Released a 2nd version of the system software on 10/24/03, which supposedly fixed the spontaneous hard reset, the MP3 caused crashes, voice guidance issues, among a slew of other problems. ..... I've used the unit since the upgrade for 10 days, and so far it's crashed once under heavy use. It's felt much more reliable as a navigation unit as well as a personal assistant. I'm tentatively upgrading the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Without its self-destructive behavior, the thoughtful tools and information available on the unit (albeit being outdated at times) are indispensible to a traveller, and they provide an invaluable sense of security. It's something that you may not want to be without once you have it. It's also better than most other guidance systems out there I've tried, including laptop units. Crashing issues aside, other ""complaints"" remain, though most of them are relatively minor, considering most other GPS units have their own set of compromises. I'm getting ready to recommend this unit to friends and family after trying it for few more weeks, and I hope it becomes more affordable.10/20/03 I have anticipated this unit for months ahead of the release. It is difficult to say that it has been worth the wait. In fact, I don't think it's a very mature or stable product for a wonderful concept. I travelled extensively after getting this unit, and I found it unreliable at best. Here is what I think:Likes:-convenient QFind which lets me find just about anything I want within my current location, with decent accuracy.-color hybrid screen that works under sunlight with the backlight off to conserve energy, also has an active write area that hids to enlarge display area.-palm functionality-integration with address book, and a find via address feature that worked better than the older (GPSV, eTrax Legend, emap) Garmin units that I've tried.-repetitive voice prompt that ensures better guidance.-SD flash memory expandibilityDislikes (serious ones, skipping minor gripes here):-crashes like mad. It resets several times daily, in various circumstances, and no clear pattern either. and yes, it does crash during navigation.-loses data without warning. In fact I just lost all my data overnight, with power in the battery and no crashes last night, and I'm travelling. Now that's just a disaster, don't you think? I suppose it's designed to travel with a laptop and a cradle?-GPS acquisition time is unusually long, much longer than what other Garmin units I tried. It usually takes at least one minute, even if I did not change location during the off time. I often find myself stopping the car waiting for it to acquire.-the audio player is a sure bet for crash, so much so that it's unusable, unless you enjoy poking the unit with a pin.-battery life is somewhat limited, but I think enough people has harped on this. I got a car cradle so it hasn't been as much a problem, but without the cradle it's very limited as a GPS guidance device. It will quit in less an hour, but it does have neat battery save feature in that it can guide with screen off, and come back on with voice prompt at turns.-some inaccuracies in the map locations and directory listings. It could take a while before we find something that actually exists, but I guess it's better than not having any reference at all.-Did I mention it crashes like crazy?I would have wholeheartedly embraced the product. The Quefind feature is a fabulous tool for travellers. I could find restaurants, shops, car rentals, parks, etc. etc., and it is invaluable during travel. However, losing data and crashing while navigating is more than irritating: it's simply dangerous and potentially disasterous. There's no excuse for the kind of reliability issue it suffers now. It has to be fixed for it to be a real usable product, rather than an expensive, stillborn concept.",2,2,0.21148863,0.28203472,0.5064767

"This is my second Lumix. This brand has earned my loyalty; let me tell you how. I was climbing the south couloir of Mount Quandary with a buddy. We were post-holing in deep early June snow (yes, we were using snowshoes, but still post-holing pretty badly), when my right foot sunk in fast; I was up to my crotch in snow and, in my flailing attempt to arrest my fall so I wouldn't start an uncontrolled fall down the mountain, I managed to knock my camera case loose from it's velcro strap and I watched helplessly as my Lumix tumbled down the south face, bouncing off the crusty snow all the way down. Having fought my way up that far (we were 3/4 the way to the summit at this point), I was not about to go down and get it, so I considered it lost. Well, my buddy looked at 14ers.com the next day and lo and behold, a climber had found my camera, with no case in sight, sticking out of the snow. I called him to ID my camera and he told me it still worked! I picked it up the next day (luckily the guy lived near Denver), and sure enough, IT WORKED. I used that camera for another 3 years before it finally started to give up the ghost, and I bought a new one a month ago. So far, so good on this one; it works as well as the previous one, and is smaller and lighter to boot. And it still features the high-quality Leica lens that the previous one had. So I do recommend this camera, folks. If it can survive a tumbling plummet down a Colorado 14er, it can take just about anything you can dish out.",2,2,0.0012260021,0.0014712481,0.9973028

"I have a dryloop DSL -- that is, a DSL line only, with no voice service.  Now that I have installed an ooma hub, I have no domestic telephone charges of any kind -- no line to pay for and free local and long distance calls, including caller-ID, call-waiting, and voicemail.  My only cost is for international calls, for which there are very low pay-as-you-go rates available from several providers, including ooma.There are two disadvantages:  Firstly, I don't have 'real' 911, and secondly, I would lose the telephone connection during a power outage or DSL interruption.  As I have a cell phone as a backup, I don't consider these problems significant.Setup and activation are made simple by excellent documentation and a friendly website.  I made things difficult for myself by not realizing that my Westell 7500 modem is actually a combined modem and router, and so I initially set up the wrong configuration.  Once I discovered my mistake, all went well.

"Used this to replace an aging stock 5400 RPM hard drive that was running out of space in an old 2009 Mac Book Pro 15&#34;.  If you know your way around the old unibody, installation is a snap.To point out the obvious, make sure you have install software available before swapping out hard drives.  You can install software via USB or the old fashioned optical drive way.  During installation if you have a USB adapter for your old drive, you can have OS X migrate your existing data, or you can use Time Machine to restore an existing backup without having to reinstall OS X at all.Also, if you have software like Parallels installed, you will need the product key handy as you need to reactivate the product upon a restore from time machine or migration.I've been using this drive for over half a year now, and have nothing but good things to say about it.

"I just got this card for a birthday present to myself. I have some Logitech Z-5500's for my speakers and have been using an Audigy 2zs card for a couple of years now. I had read that these new X-FI cards were quite a bit better and I also wanted the new EAX 5 and optical connections so I decided to go for this new one.Well, I expected a decent bump in clarity and overall sound but I have to say I am blown away at the difference this new card makes! I honestly feel that this new X-fi is 5-10 times better than the Audigy 2 zs. EVERYTHING sounds SO much better....from games to DVD's and especially music. I always thought that music played through that Audigy 2zs was quite bland and now that I have tunes pumping out of these Z5500's it's now abundently clear. I have been missing so much and not even coming cloes to utilizing these fantastic speakers.I did have a little trouble getting the drivers properly loaded up because it kept telling me I have a newer version of the drivers already. So the installer would quit. it was seeing my Audigy 2 drivers even though I had deleted everything. I ended up grabbing a set of beta Vista drivers for this X-Fi and that installer saw the older drivers and gave me an option to delete them and also write over any sound drivers left behind. So I got the drivers on, loaded up the control center, and then put on Alchemy. I didn't even use the cd that came in the box but note, they put a lot of stuff on it that you may want to use.I hooked up my Z-5500's with an optical cable, made the proper adjustments in Vista and the control center, and things sound fantastic. With control center you can switch between a gaming, entertainment, and  audio creation mode. They also have a crystalizer program in there that when activated makes everything sound so crisp you wont' believe your ears.So if you are contemplating getting one of these go ahead and do so. If you already own an Audigy 2zs MAKE SURE to do so, you won't be disappointed. Please note that if you are running standard, run of the mill speakers you probably aren't going to hear that much of a difference. But if you have a nice set of speakers you will.I have this plugged into my 780i SLI board. I am using the third ""sli"" slot on the bottom and it works perfectly.

"This is my first Kindle jacket for my very first Kindle, so I have nothing to compare this to. I'd bought my mother a Kindle 3 with the case usually offered up by Amazon, with the built-in light, but I knew I wanted something that didn't ""attach"" itself to the Kindle, and after reading the reviews on this one and viewing the photos, I knew this is the one for me.It's exactly as I expected it to be. It's sturdy, light, attractive, and pretty much everything everyone has said it to be.My only suggestion for improvement is to make the zippers actually reversible. They aren't. You can fold the jacket back and zip it up, sure, but the zipper handles/tabs have to remain on the inside of the case. Actual reversible zippers have handles/tabs that can migrate to the other side, and these don't have them.Not a big deal, but it would have made this near-perfect jacket perfect, and it would have made the claim of reversible zippers more true. :)",2,2,0.0010519451,0.004382018,0.99456596
"First, here is the main Con:With Windows 7 on my laptop, I first installed the driver and Ralink software, and it said to hook up my Alfa AWUS036NH before installation of the Ralink software. After it installed, none of my internet connections worked, even after three restarts and troubleshooting. I finally had to use System Restore to remove the installation of the driver and Ralink package. And then to my surprise, my Alfa AWUS036NH started working just fine. I ended up going to the Alfa Network website and downloaded everything I needed to get everything working. I noticed that with the downloaded driver and software, it installed an older version of the Ralink software which was the same I used with my Etekcity WiFi Usb adapter.Lesson learned and shared, throw away that CD as soon as you open the box.Pro:The stock antenna actually works better than the extra directional antenna for long range when connecting to an AP that has an indoor antenna. I imagine that is because I did not have direct line of sight to am indoor based AP antenna and could not aim the directional antenna properly.Right now I am using the stock omni-directional antenna to connect with my library that is across the street, their AP antenna is indoors and about 300 feet away. I live in a basement apartment and used the suction cup attachment to mount the Alfa AWUS036NH to the window. I am also using a parabolic reflector made from a soda can to increase signal strength.  I see a 40% signal strength over my old Etekcity USB WiFi adaptor and have an average dbm of -71. I consider that pretty good since I do not have direct line of sight to my library and that the signal has to go through a chain link fence three feet in front of my window, several parked cars and a fairly high traffic street in Downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma. I should also mention that the antenna is eight inches above the ground. In the front lobby of my apartment building which faces the library, I get a signal strength of 90% and average a dbm of -31. At the moment I can see thirteen signals from within my apartment building and three from outside incuding my local ambulance which must be stopped at a red light.If you do not have conditions worse than I have, then I can highly recommend this product. If you have worse conditions, then you will need an outdoor antenna.",2,2,0.24932244,0.13757165,0.6131059

"Having used dozens of mobile devices for many years, starting with Palm and Pocket PCs, I have purchased and tested just about every screen protector known to exist.  The Steinheil Crystal Clear by Spigen SCP is the best there is, bar none.  I have installed many Steinheils on numerous smartphones, a Moto Xoom, Fire 1 and Fire 8.9"" HD, Nexus 7, Nexus 10 and even my Cowon J3.  They are outstanding -- literally crystal clear and very, very easy to install.  What's more, they barely show any wear -- even after two or three years.I do not understand the reports of installation difficulty as this is the easiest installation of a screen protector I have experienced.  The protector is just rigid enough to be able to place it exactly where desired.  I recommend studying the area to be covered, centering the *unaltered* protector (before removing protective plastic) on the display area to see exactly how  it will appear after installed. Then, in a dust-free environment, peel back ONLY a very small portion of the plastic on the screen/adhesive side and carefully place the two corners where desired.  Then, while smoothing at the same time, slowly peel away the remaining plastic while simultaneous smoothing with light pressure as you go.  You should not see more than one, perhaps two, air bubbles (if at all) that are easily moved to the edges and eliminated.Honestly, this is the easiest protector to install and I have tried them all.  The results are stunning and the protector is nearly invisible once installed.  The Crystal Clear Steinheil is the only protector I will use on my devices.  Highly recommended.I agree with a previous reviewer and wish that Spigen offered their tempered glass protector for the Nexus 10.",2,2,0.0006565072,0.0015942608,0.99774915
"I waited for awhile before writing a review of this camcorder because I felt that it wouldn't be fair to use it once and then write a review based on that single experience.  Instead, I've used the camera on a number of occasions since Easter.  These included Easter egg hunts, birthday parties, pool parties, and general video work just to test it out.  So far I've had no problems with the camera.It is very handy and its compact size makes it easy to haul around.  Using the smaller discs has not been a problem so far.  In fact, I haven't had any problems with playback, recording, editing, or picture quality.  The only problem that I've noticed is that the mic works almost too good, catching the rustling of the wind in many of the videos I've shot.  However, my old VHS camcorder did the same thing, even with a sound buffer attached to it.The only times that I've run into problems have been due to operator error.  My wife forgot to finalize one of the discs and it did not work properly.  However, after we talked about it and read through the manual, we pinpointed the problem and she hasn't had any trouble since.  Operator error seems to be the primary culprit in most of the negative reviews that I've read here.  I've been guilty of doing the same thing that many other people have done with this product.  We toss the instructions to the wayside and decide that we can figure out how to operate the device on our own.  This can sometimes be a costly mistake.  Luckily, I haven't had to pay too much for what I've done with any of my toys....yet.This is a great camera for beginners to learn the ins-and-outs of DVD camcorders.  Granted, it isn't very forgiving when you make a mistake, but more expensive (and more complicated) models are just as ruthless.

"Works fine with the Jensen VM9424 with the required adapter cable.  The adapter cable makes the installation a plug and chug operation.  No need to splice wires or anything such.I was able to mount the antenna ontop the unit right next to the GPS and there's no interferrance whatsoever.As for flashing, running windows7 64bit and had no trouble getting the firmware to run and do its thing.Quality wise - what can I say ?  This is going to be tucked away from site so who cares what it looks like?  I made sure to electrical tape all the connectors to give it added grip.  I placed the system box and receive in the footwell of the vehicle and have the antenna ontop the receive unit.  Cords are plenty long enough for this.Yes, this would've been very nice if it were integrated with the receiver unit.  But get over it - it's not, and you can only make do with what you got. In this case, the XM now has the appearance of being fully integrated and I'm quite happy with it.Edit:  Unit has been working great for almost a year.  I love this thing.

"I bought this with a few things in mind: sweat-proof, comfort, stays on my ears and doesn't fall out, and decent sound. After almost two years of use, they are still going strong and met my needs.What I use them for:- Weight lifting, 1-2 hours(they are able to stay on whether I am on a bench or machine)- Running, 1-15 miles typically (they are able to stay on even if I bob and weave or shake my head, they handle the sweat)- Casual listening (whether I am traveling on a plane, train, or automobile, they block outside noise superbly well)Pros:- Can handle immense amounts of sweat without losing sound or having them fall off- They stay put: The wire next to the earbud is made a bit stiffer so you can form it around your ear. AWESOME idea, whoever did this.- Block outside noise: Almost like a noise-cancelling earphone, but without the price- Fit great: They come with multiple ear pieces, so you can customize them to the size ear you have- Durability: I have had these for almost two years, whereas other sport headphones would last me a year tops before sweat would break them downCon:- The earpiece can sometimes slip off the actual headphone when wet. This only happens when I am taking off my earphones, and not when I am using them. This can be frustrating as you have to pull the piece out of your ear or find the piece rolling on the floor somewhere. (see my update and comments: there is a quick solution to this concern)Overall, I would recommend these earphones to anyone. I gave them 5 stars because they are so much better compared to other sport earphones I have used. Overall, they earn the karate chop award.UPDATE: After originally posting this review, customer service responded within 24 hours to my concerns about the earpieces slipping off. Their solution worked great (see the comments)! I think their quick response speaks highly about their product and the company.

"I bought this remote in attempt to replace several remotes and simplify watching TV.  My setup includes a Sony TV, Sony VCR, Sony DVD player, Dish TR40 digital TV converter box, Samsung DTB-H260F HDTV tuner, and a Channel Master antenna rotater. I didn't think I'd ever find a remote that would handle all of these components. This remote is up to the task.The Sony items were a no-brainer. The remote operated these items out of the box.  The digital converter box and HDTV tuner were a little more difficult. Codes are provided, but none seemed to work for me. However, since the remote can learn from other remotes, I was able to program pretty much all of the functions into the Sony remote. I used the same process for the antenna rotater.Not all was perfect with this remote. I wanted to program a macro to make it play a VCR tape. To do this, I had to switch my TV input to VHS. My Sony TV has several inputs, and requires three clicks of the ""TV/Video"" button to get it from it's usual input to the one I use for the VCR. No matter what I did, the macro would only switch the input twice, equal to pressing the TV/Video button twice. If it had done this correctly I would have given it five stars.I still haven't found out if there is a memory limit to how many functions you can teach the remote or how many macros it will run, unlike a one for all remote I also own.One feature I do like is where you can program a button such as ""TV"" to do more than one operation by holding it down two seconds. I made it so that when you do this it turns the TV on as well as turns the HDTV tuner on. Very handy, especially when you are telling someone unfamiliar with your set-up how to watch TV. ""Just hold the TV button down for two seconds, then operate as normal...""",2,2,0.001910544,0.019109318,0.9789802
"I bought these to replace an old Plantronic set where the cord became tangled. When I received this pair, it was packaged very well and it came as stated on here. Hooking them up was easy. The only thing is that I didn't read the instructions so I couldn't figure out why the mic wasn't working. Turns out I didn't align the triangles correctly to get the mic prong to push all the way into the headset. Now that I know that, removing it is very easy (but I do not since I bought them for gaming)As far as sound is concerned it is very good, but not top-of-the-line type. The bass response if good, but can get muddy during times when there is a lot of explosions going on (I play MW2 and LFD2), but it is not very noticable. The mid and high range sound is excellent, much better than my old plantronics set. I found myself being able to hear enemies coming from behind, but I had not experienced before. Also, these are ALMOST noise canceling  headphones. It drowns out a lot more noise than my old set, which is a good thing, so I don't have to hear my wife nagging me :-P The microphone is, well, a mic. It does not get in the way for me when drinking or anything. If it does for other people, then it can bend out of the way or you can take the mic out!ComfortFirst off I need to state that I have a fairly large head but not freakishly large that nothing will ever fit. These headphones are comfortable on the ears. They fit nicely around my entire ear and do not get hot. However, after having these for about a week, I noticed that if I am in a long session (2 hours or so) the top part that goes over my head does begin to become uncomfortable, but I rarely play for more than 2 hours so it is no big deal. Adjusting it so it doesn't hurt my head makes the whole set feel uncomfortable which is why I only gave it 4 stars.Overall, this is a great headset and will serve many people very well in their audio experience.UPDATE 8/18/2011The headset still sounds great, but the mic doesn't seem to pick up my voice as well as my old plantronics set. I do believe it has something to do with the angle in which the mic is positioned because if I press it slightly closer to my mouth, people can hear me better. I tried it with 2 sound cards to make sure that was not the problem. Using the different sound cards, I encountered the same problem with the mic. Unfortunately, this is not conducive to online gaming or even making VOIP calls so I must deduct 1 star and make it 3 stars instead.UPDATE 10/6/2012The head set broke :( The ear piece broke off the head band...Lasted two years but you would think that for the price they would last longer. I went to a plantronic headset (cheap one) and I really miss the low end bass from these bad boys.",2,2,0.0046802103,0.038167346,0.95715237

Very easy set up.  I bought this as a back up device when my cloud backup did not include all of my files and when my second internal hard drive used for backup was corrupted by a faulty motherboard.  Included software is transparent and requires no additional activity once it is set up.  The acid test will be if I need to restore a back up due to system failure.

"I bought this projector back in 2006 and it has been a great projector.  I am on my third bulb and every bulb lasted righ at about 3000 hours.  The screen I have is 180"" and the picture is great.The only problem I have had with it is just like several people described.  After about 3 years when I would turn it on after about 3 minutes it would turn off and the power light would turn yellow.  I thought about taking it in like most of the reviews I saw said they did, however the local place wanted $100 just to look at it.  So I did a search on youtube and found that the iris is the problem with a very simple fix.  The problem is that the iris isn't lubricated.  When you take the panel off to replace the bulb there is a gold collored plastic piece toward the front of the bulb.  If you manually push it, it should snap back very fast.  If it is slow then it needs lubricated.  All I do is use a q-tip and spray a little WD-40 on it and rub it around the rod that is attached to the Iris.  Once it is lubricated it works for about 6 months watching it everyday.  This is a very easy fix that a repair shop would charge over $300 to replace the iris.This is a great projector and it has worked for me for over 6 years with just a little maintainence needed every now and then.",2,2,0.0028207996,0.007987715,0.9891915

"Recieved my 1000HA a few days ago and have been using it nonstop since then.  In the past days the unit has exceeded my expectations and re-inforced my choice :)I researched the purchase of a NetBook for about a month prior to making a decision.  Among those I considered were the EEE1000HA, EEE901, Aspire One and MSI Wind.  The MSI Wind somehow did not appeal to me so I excluded that right away.  I played with the Aspire One at the store for a while and could not get used to the side mouse button configuration which I found extremely frustrating to use. I also did not like the fact that the 6 cell battery on the Acer was only 2700mAH and the weight with the 6 cell was 2.8 lbs which was almost as heavy as the 10"" 1000HA.The 901 I excluded because the keyboard was a bit too miniscule.  Even though portability was extremely important to me I felt the 901 is just too small and would tire me out with anything more than 15 mins of usage.  That left the 1000HA.  I chose it because I felt it was a perfect fit.- Great battery life, I get a solid 5 hrs with wi-fi/video/audio activity.  The suggested 7 hrs is not happening but 5hrs is very realistic to expect with typical use.- Plays DVDs great with absolutely no jerking, I use DVDShrink to create an ISO image of a DVD and transfer it using an SDHC card.  The unit ships with Intervideo DVD preinstalled which can play a DVD directly from a location on the hard disk.- Awesome keyboard: for such a small unit I am thankful that the keyboard is so easy to use, it is 95% the size of a regular keyboard- 10"" screen is perfect size: I felt this size is the best compromise between portability and functionality, it does not cause any undue eyestrain.  The LCD is bright and colors look great.- Very portable: At 3.2lbs it's a good bit lighter than my Thinkpad T60 and the lack of weight is definitely noticable, I feel this netbook is at the limit of how small a portable computer should be.  Anything smaller is going to be really difficult to use.  The power adapter is also quite dimunitive.- Comes with a nice soft case and LCD cleaning cloth- Webcam:  The webcam at 1.3 Megapixel is extraordinary for a unit of this size and price point.  It is very clear and the embedded microphone does a great job.  I am able to videoconference with friends in Europe and Asia via Skype (which is pre-installed) with excellent results.The 160GB hard drive is partitioned into 80GB and 60GB usable partitions.  The other 20GB is supposed to be some kind of hidden recovery partition in case the system crashes, not sure about it.  For a netbook 140GB is plenty anyway so I'm not concerned.My only gripe about the unit is that the trackpad buttons are hard to press.  The left button doesn't bother me so much because I started to use tap to click and it works very well, but right clicking is still hard.  The gestures are great but I haven't had a chance to use that very much.Asus has carefully thought out the design of this unit and it shows in how easy and intuitive it is to use.  I think this unit delivers a lot for it's price and if you're looking for an extremely portable machine with all the basic capabilities most of us will use on the road you cannot go wrong with the 1000HA.Highly recommended!",2,2,0.012990214,0.030609949,0.95639974
"I have used this with my Escort SRX and my new Escort 9500ix. It works beautifully to amplify the ramp up on all detectors and spoken words on the 9500ix very clearly and above my loud music and/or open windows. I have it mounted under my dash panel, and it is still loud and clear (I have the detector set at about half volume, although it goes to almost maximum volume without distorting). The included wire tap makes installation easy. I suggest hard wiring your detector at the same time using the escort hard-wire kit, since most of the cable snaking and wire taping labor can be combined with the install of this speaker. My only complaint is that the fuse holder is cheap and opened itself up (causing the power to turn off), but a little bit of tape over the fuse holder stopped that problem from re-occurring.",2,2,0.0005047754,0.0017431076,0.99775213

"I'm really happy with these headphones. Sounds every bit as good as being wired. I use them for watching TV or playing xbox after my wife and kids go to bed. They are extremely comfortable. They fit ""over-the-ear"" which I highly recommend. Some other headphone model are ""on-the-ear"" which I find to be less comfortable.I do have a few small complaints/things to consider before purchasing these:I'm not crazy about the fact that their are volume controls in 3-places with this setup; I can adjust volume my stereo receiver, the RS 160 transmitter, and the RS 160 headset. Guess I'm just unsure of how to adjust all the knobs to get the optimal sound quality. The instructions say to have your sound source at a ""medium"" volume.As one other reviewer mentioned it's a little bit annoying that the RS 160 transmitter powers down when not in use even if it is plugged into the wall. This means every time I want to use my headphone I have to go into my cabinet to turn on the transmitter and also turn on the headset. It would be nicer if I could just grab the headset off my coffee table and turn it on.Also when you want to power down the headset you have to hold the power button for 1 second. If you don't hold it down that long the headset just goes into mute mode. It appears to be off but the battery drains. Not that big of a deal but not the greatest user interface in my opinion.Again I do recommend this product and I am very happy with my purchase just a couple of quirks.",2,2,0.0013728362,0.012844516,0.9857826
"After installing this case fan, my hard drive temperatures went down about 5 degrees Celsius from my previous case fan, which was a Zalman 92MM. The Zalman was silent, but it didn't move much air.  You can hear this fan, but the noise is not objectionable to me. It is rated at 35 dB(A).The fan has two connections (you can only use one): 1. a small three pin connector, which plugs directly into the motherboard (fan RPM is displayed if you enter setup at start-up), or 2. a four pin (Molex) power connector.  Initially, I connected the three pin connector to the motherboard, but the fan speed was only about the same power as the Zalman, which was not much, but it was silent. After I disconnected the three pin connector, and then used the four pin connector instead, it really moved the air (56 CFM), but then it was audible.Hard drives don't care much for heat; a lesson I painfully learned after my two year old hard drive failed a year ago.  Since my computer runs in a fairly warm environment, especially in summer, I'm glad I made this purchase.UPDATE:  As of 4/1/2012, this fan has been cooling my computer for more than two and a half years with absolutely no problems--hard drive or other.",2,2,0.005210499,0.04192189,0.95286757

"So far I'm very impressed with theLogitech Wireless Illuminated Keyboard K800, and I'm not an easy customer by any stretch of the imagination. In Logitech's defense I didn't really know what I wanted when I first started shopping around, but I soon discovered that I was basically looking for a wireless keyboard that closely mimics (and improves upon) typical laptop keyboards.I tried out and got rid of:A. theLogitech Wireless Wave Combo Mk550 With Keyboard and Laser Mouse (920-002555)(keys and keyboard were too big and keys had too much travel),B. theLogitech Cordless Desktop MX 5500 Revolution Bluetooth Mouse and Keyboard(excellent mouse, but I didn't like the full-sized keys on the keyboard, they had too much `press down' resistance when typing),C. theLogitech MK710 Wireless Desktop Mouse and Keyboard Combo (920-002416)(a close second place, but it lacked short-travel scissor-switch keys and the edge-to-edge glossy surface was prone to smudges and scratches), andD. theLogitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750(deserving of an honorable mention, but it felt a bit flimsy, also had an edge-to-edge glossy surface that was prone to smudges and scratches, and some of the reviews mentioned problems with recharging the internal battery via the solar panels (I didn't encounter that problem, but I'd have to put it in the 'hard error' category)).Pros:1. Low-profile scissor-switch keys have short travel, low 'press down' resistance, and excellent spring back (which may actually be the definition of 'scissor-switch' keys), which allows for fast and low-effort typing (exactly what I've been looking for, this was easily my top priority when testing out keyboards).2. No noticeable initial connection lag immediately after booting up the computer and no noticeable lag or dropped keystrokes during operation (yay for Unifying receivers! If you are also using Bluetooth or other RF transceivers along with the Unifying receiver then try to keep them spread out among your USB ports (if possible), they can jam each other up pretty well when in close proximity).3. Good quality black matte finish material along top and bottom portions of keyboard's surface that is a bit more resistant to smudges and scratches than the glossy surface alternative (the middle portion surrounding the keys still has the same anti-scratch-resistant glossy surface mentioned above, but the glossy surface isn't edge-to-edge, so the wear and tear should be minimal).4. Illuminating keys with adjustable illumination levels (options of `no illumination' or one of four brightness levels), adjustable illumination times (10 sec, 20 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 5 mins, 10 mins), optional keystroke activated or motion-activated illumination (keyboard lights up when you move your hand(s) over the keyboard's surface at about an inch above the surface), and an option to disable keyboard illumination completely (extends battery life between recharges). I actually disable the illumination most of the time, but I'm sure I'll activate it when I'm working late at night while others are sleeping. It probably sounds strange, but the illumination aspect is actually pretty low on my priority list (icing on the cake, but I had to find a cake that met my standards first).5. Rechargeable batteries via USB charging cable. It'll be nice to recharge the batteries instead of replacing them (I ended up buying rechargeable AAs for the media pad that came in myLogitech diNovo Media Desktop Laserbecause it would burn through standard AAs so quickly).6. Sturdy design and good size for keyboard and keys.Cons:1. Quite difficult to access rechargeable AAs in keyboard. The battery panel has a small screw that you have to unscrew and then the battery cover still doesn't come off very easily (I didn't get it all the way off because I was worried about breaking it). I have other rechargeable AAs (that I charge in a wall charger) that I'd like to be able to swap in if the rechargeable AAs that come with the keyboard start to drain too quickly with age. It would also be nice to have the option to run the keyboard off of standard AAs (I promise I won't plug the keyboard into the USB charging cable when it's powered via the standard AAs).2. Removing the rechargeable AAs voids the warranty (I can see the reasoning, because I can only imagine what would happen if someone tried to recharge standard AAs, but it still falls in the 'Cons' category).3. Keyboard comes with USB charging cable but doesn't come with USB wall-charger adapter and the USB charging cable seems a bit short (myLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Maccame with a USB charging cable that's at least twice as long and also came with a USB wall-charger adapter, so I'm using that USB cable and wall-charger to charge the mouse and keyboard as needed).4. Scratch and smudge prone glossy surface surrounding the keys. While the glossy surface only makes up a small portion of the keyboard's surface I think it should be removed completely in favor of a black matte finish material that is much more durable.Possible Alternative:I also looked into theLogitech Wireless Combo Mk520 With Keyboard and Laser Mouse (920-002553), because at first glance the keyboard appears to be a non-illuminating version of theLogitech Wireless Illuminated Keyboard K800for a little over half the price (and it includes a mouse), but I read some complaints that the keys are harder to press and lower quality than the keys on the K800, which was leading to typing fatigue after extensive use. Avoiding typing fatigue is by far my biggest priority (which is why I went through so many keyboards), so I didn't even bother testing the Mk520 out.Overall I think theLogitech Wireless Illuminated Keyboard K800is an excellent keyboard. I've read complaints about the small `F1' through `F12' keys and the fact that you have to press the `FN' button to access the second functions that the `F1' through `F12' keys respectively have (as far as I can tell there is no `F-Lock' capability for this keyboard), but I don't see either of these issues being a problem for me.",2,2,0.0010374214,0.00299517,0.9959674

"This lens turns my Panasonic G3 camera into a fine backup for my Canon 5D2 DSLR.  My walk-around lens for the 5D2 is the Canon 24-70mmL.  The Panny GX Vario PZ 14-42 gives me a similar range equivalent which is where I capture the majority of my images on the 5D2.  Like with my Canon L lens, I've taken numerous shots with this Panny lens at f/11, and once I put them through Photoshop using luminosity sharpening, these images are VERY nice when it comes to sharpness.  Sure, the Panny 20mm pancake f 1.7 is also a fine lens for this camera but sometimes you just don't want to compose with your feet.  So the PZ 14-42mm gives you a convenient flexibility that the 20mm prime does not.  My other lens for the G3 is the nice Panny 14-140mm but this larger heavier lens tends to unbalance the G3 somewhat, and even though the reach of this lens is nice, it's sharpness is not quite as good as the PZ 14-42 in my opinion.  The PZ makes the G3, and other small cameras like it, a small convenient package with a capability such that you will find the G3 combined with the PZ 14-42 lens a formidable photographic tool (for what it is).  Using this combo as your grab-and-go camera or for those times (i.e.: moderate hiking) when you don't want the ""brick"" on your shoulder, you will likely find that the disappointing ""compromise"" that you might expect from carrying a ""small"" camera is not the disappointment you were expecting.  The OIS seems to work quite well and is handy in light of the F3.5-5.6 ASPH. Yeah, low light shooting may not be your cup of tea with this lens, but that's what the 20mm pancake will work better in.  SO, why 4 stars instead of 5 for the PZ 14-42?  Because 5 stars is essentially ""perfect"", this lens is not, and few lenses are.This is my walking around lens for my G3 now.",2,2,0.000433388,0.002095132,0.99747145

"I pre-ordered this camera from Sony way back in November of 2005. It was shipped to me before Christmas that year. Ever since, I have used the camera as a stock photographer and a family photographer.  The personal photos have been excellent and print very sharp to at least 8.5x11 (though in Photoshop the linear dimensions are poster size).Unfortunately, the main failing has been in the color noise and artifacting for stock photography. Because I do not use a tripod for on-the-fly outdoor shots, I have gotten used to either spending hours with Photoshop fixing the ""purple fringes"" (also cyan and red shifts) or just submitting the full-sun shots and hope the inspector will tolerate a bit of color noise for the shadier areas.The lack of any image stabilizing process (as the newer Sony/Minolta cameras have) is the major problem. Because my acceptance rate is less than 50%, and the most common reason given for rejection is color noise and artifacting, I'm waiting for the release of Canon's new DSLR (the 40D?), which might or might not have the same MP resolution as the Sony DSC R1, but it's a true SLR with image stabilization. For prosumer use, therefore, the R1 is not adequate because of its lack of in-camera image stabilization.Nonetheless, the built-in flash is bright enough for most medium- and close-range use (especially since it's positioned right above the lens, minimizing the outline shadows where the flash is offset), the focal range goes from wide angle to medium telephoto, the Sony tripod with remote control works fine with this camera (if you can tolerate using a tripod), the memory cards in 2 formats (MS and CF) allow for great utility (e.g., in-camera backup), the interfaces are handy (I back up in the field on an iPod 80GB), iPhoto runs fine with the R1 connected, and the camera's fake shutter sound can be turned off for absolutely silent candid photos (especially since people don't realize that you're focusing using the top-mounted LCD viewfinder). The diopter adjustment of the optical viewfinder can be set precisely.Not so nice is the placement of the hot shoe for the external flash to the right, above the grip/battery compartment. The shadows cast are dense and distracting, although the Sony smart flash works extremely well. Also, I have lost 2 Memory Sticks and 1 Compact Flash card--all 2 GB--until I read on the web the recommendation that memory cards should be formatted by the camera rather than by a computer. I did that with one card which I eventually filled with pictures of our first grandchild (a couple of hundred photos), when the camera suddenly showed ""Format Error."" I couldn't get a professional recovery company to rescue anything, even when I said they could open up the card to get inside, voiding the money-back guarantee. So...I've been deleting pictures one by one, using the camera itself (very tedious), rather than having the R1 or my iMac do the re-formatting. (A couple of e-mails to Sony resulted in polite replies, but no action.)Another limitation of the R1 is that it is hard to protect it. The Sony hard-leather case is so strangely shaped that putting the cover on and taking it off take too much time for field use. So I use the camera without  the rather costly leather case I bought from Sony.The LCD viewfinder, being on top of the camera, puts off subjects who are in groups waiting for their souvenir photo because they think you're adjusting the camera instead of composing the picture. So I find I use the optical viewfinder most of the time, especially with the superimposed grid to help me align vertical and horizontal planes. I do wish that Sony had provided some kind of bellows hood for the optical viewfinder. In bright sunlight, the LCD viewfinder is hard to see, and the bright reflections in the optical viewfinder requires me to wear a baseball cap or use my hand to shade it.The self-timer (with camera on a tripod) is excellent--people can be warned that the amber light will flash slowly when the self-timer is on, and will flash rapidly just before the shutter trips. Still, if I have forgotten to turn on the audio shutter sound, people stand there for a few seconds, not realizing the photo has been taken.After a year and a half of using this camera, I am very glad I had it as my starter camera for semi-pro photography. And I still have another year and a half to go on the service/repair extended warranty I bought and have not needed. But I'm saving money to take a step up, perhaps to a true SLR from Canon or Nikon.",2,1,0.3270396,0.56836915,0.10459129

"Fabulous.I recently purchased a Macbook, and posted a rating for the Apple magic mouse I subsequently bought (now returned).As far as I can tell, so far, there are really no cons to this mouse, so here's the good stuff:-Comfortable: Though the mouse is incredibly small, it's also a good shape, and fits my (size large) hands just fine.  Very comfortable to use.-Laser: This thing tracks on just about anything, which is really a boon when you take your laptop everywhere.  I can't say enough about the tracking of this mouse.  For the price, it's insanely good.-Battery life: Is fantastic so far.  I leave it on by accident all the time, and it's still going strong on the first battery after 2 months.  Time will tell if it gets the battery life advertised here, but I will update if it suddenly dies or the battery life is somehow much different than advertised.-Cheap: Really for the price, I feel like I got a great product.  Unless it breaks suddenly in the next year, I don't feel I spent too much on this at all.  In contrast, the Apple magic mouse (which this mouse won out against) is $70, and for me, doesn't work as well.  So yeah, $16 feels pretty great.All in all, I would highly recommend this mouse.",2,2,0.0009952132,0.0033620298,0.9956428

"I am not affiliated with Samsung or CNET.[Side Note:  I believe Samsung should provide free 2014 One connect boxes to F9000 owners because of the H265 codec, Google's superior VP9 codec, and HDMI 2.0 as a gesture of good faith toward early adopters.]This review will help you get the most out of your HU8550.  I won't waste your time listing all the specs.I am posting here because some people badmouthed and down rated the Samsung F9000 because they did not know how to use it.  I do not want the same thing to happen to this excellent TV.  I have last year's top-of-the-line F9000 4K model which is virtually the exact same TV as this, released only 5 months earlier.  Only the Smart Hub software and HDMI ports changed.I cannot believe how absolutely amazing the picture is.  It's colors explode, it's blacks are black, it's whites are white, flesh tones are real, and all of it is super sharp.  With newscasts or interviews, people look like they're sitting right in front of you.  It's almost scarey. Aerial shots and night shots of cities will blow you away. You cannot ask for a better picture.  And that's not just my opinion, read all of the professional reviews.  Every single one of them love this TV.NOTICE: Do not worry about 4K content not being available.  This TV upscales. It has to because the screen is made of 3840 X 2160 pixels. Go to [....] and check the US news section. I quote it in the comments section.  The upscaling of Samsung's Quadmatic Picture Engine works wonders, especially with anything in HD (1080P).  It also works fine with SD material but not as well because upscaling works with the material it starts with.  That's what it scales up.  I can honestly tell you that I do not want a sharper picture than this.  You can see every facial feature including eyelashes.  Blu Rays and 4K YouTube's will make you cry.  Pause the picture anywhere, even get close to it, and be amazed.Any person giving this TV anything less than five stars reveals their own foolishness for not setting it up, or they got a weird factory defect.  You have to set it up(calibrate it for your room).  If you are a newbie to electronics you have three options.1.  Learn how to set it up and you'll love it.  It is very easy.(I will help you in this post).2.  If you're too lazy, don't buy a piece of high-quality electronic equipment like this.  You don't deserve it.3.  Pay someone to calibrate it for you.  Actually that's a waste of money because in 20 minutes you can easily do it yourself with this post.  You can make this TV look anyway you want it to look.  Which is why comparisons in stores are superfluous unless you make all settings equal between the TVs.Out of the box the picture looks disappointing , that's Samsung's fault, although most manufacturers do the same thing for the retail store lighting.  When I first turned on this TV it looked like a soap opera or documentary.  I knew this was not right.Because I researched the F9000 (same internals as Hu8550) I knew what to do.  The first thing to do is go to the System menu, scroll to the Eco-Solution Submenu, and turn OFF the accursed eco-saving feature and eco-sensor.CNET has evaluators that are among the best in the industry.  A professional named Katzmaier uses $30,000 worth of equipment to calibrate these TVs.  Don't know if I can post links here, so search for CNET's HDTV picture settings forum forUN65f9000 or HU8550-a bit early for this as of this date.  (The 55 inch versions take the same calibrations.)However, there's one problem with their settings.  They calibrate their TVs in a dark room.  Therefore their brightness levels are way too low.  They acknowledge this, but it is a necessary starting point and equalizer for the different models.  No problem, use Samsung's default settings for Movie and set Backlight to their setting(12).  It worked great with gamma at +1.  The first thing you want to do is set it to Movie mode, which is what CNET uses.  Play with other modes later.---------------------The settings I'm about to list are based on Katzmaier's from CNET(get them and print them out) with some tweaks of my own made by going between his and the Samsung defaults.  Do that, that's safe.  If you set your TV to these, you will love the picture.  If not, tweak it for yourself somewhere between his settings and the defaults.It is very easy, so don't freak out.  If you can turn your volume control up and down you can change your settings.  The settings have a combined effect, so do not just do one area.HOW TO SET A FANTASTIC PICTURE AND REMOVE MOTION BLURR/Judder:Picture menu - Use all Samsung's defaults for Movie mode with a slight color tweakmode: Movie - the most important change.backlight: 12 - CNET's setting of 7 is way too low unless you are in a really dark room.  We use lamps at my house.  Backlight is the main brightness controlcontrast: 95 -  pretty standard for most modesbrightness: 45 - leave this alonesharpness: 20 - CNET setting of 0 Is WAY too low, especially for a 4K TVcolor: 52 0r 53 - a slight tweak over 50 that will give you more of a richer plasma TV qualitytint: 50/50 - leave this aloneI discovered the real trick for getting the correct lighting level for your room is to work with gamma and backlight, not brightness.  Samsung's default is 45 for all modes, and it's right.Advanced Settings Click it for the submenudynamic contrast: offflesh tone: zeroRGB only mode: offcolor space: custom - there is a submenu for this below.White balance: see below.  Click it to get into it.10 P white balance: - you don't need to mess with this.Gamma: +1 --this is an important setting and affects the entire picture, not just contrast.Expert pattern: offmotion lighting: offblack enhancer: offColor Space SubmenuI recommend keeping everything at default rather than using the ones from CNET.  However, I do not like the cold (bluer)picture of LEDs as compared to plasma or my old Pioneer elite 98 which had the best picture ever in its day and even for today except for sharpness.  Therefore I change the blue setting to this:blue: red 2, green 2, blue 45. Not drastic changes over 0, 0, 50 but it's warmer and prettier.Leave yellow at the default, or change the yellow setting to have less blue than the CNET settingyellow: red 50, green 50, blue 6  (Katzmaier had blue at 14, that's too much)White Balance - use all of the Katzmaier's settings: 25, 24, 22, 23, 24, 26EDIT:  Thanks to James Goss who says:For the 8550, the white balance numbers range from -25 to +25, with 0 being the defaults. So your figures equate to 0, -1, -3, -2, -1, +1.Picture Option Submenu -color tone: warm 2 - important, this also gets rid of the cold blue LED effectdigital clean view: offMPEG noise filter: offfilm mode: auto oneauto motion plus: custom.

Numerous sources recommend these to remove motion blur.blur reduction: 10judder reduction: 0  yes, zeroLED clear motion: - not much visible difference either way.  Leave it on if you increased backlight to the default.System Menu.  As already mentioned go to the eco-solution submenu and shut off energy-saving and eco-sensors.  They will knock your picture into dismal oblivion at will.Sound menu:  For a TV, the sound can be good, but the default sound is horribly muddy as are all of the choices except Clear Voice.  The high frequencies are weak, and you should never expect good bass from any TV.  Go into the Sound menu and set to Clear Voice if you sometimes watch without your stereo system.---------------------------GREAT INTERFACE FEATURES:This TV works great with Smart Hub and smart phones, tablets, or Blu Ray, especially for Samsung products.  Other Android and Apple products should be compatible, but I can't speak for them.  I am a Samsung Galaxy XX fan myself.You can wirelessly stream from TV to Phone or tablet with the Samsung Smart View app, and your phone functions as a remote.  It works!  However, get the app for your phone manufacturer.  Don't expect Samsung's app to work on a different phone.You can wirelessly stream from Phone/tablet to TV by setting your TV Source to Mirror, and your device to Mirror in your settings >connections, and allow the connection.  You do not need to register the TV and agree to Samsung's invasion of privacy policy.You can also wirelessly view pics, video.etc, from your phone on the TV by enabling the DLNA device connection on your phone and going into Smart Hub Picture/video section (up top, far right, go to the bottom and select all files, and enable the connection.  It's easy.You can also use a hardwire HDMI connection for any of the above but why bother.______________________Complaint Section1.  Samsung - Stop defeating your own purpose with the horrible original settings.  I want a free 2014 One connect box and it needs VP9 not just H265.2.  People do not want the ridiculous hand controls that only work half the time at best, or the worthless voice controls the get activated by the TV program you're watching.  Thanks for the great picture though, stick with what matters.3.  Your privacy policy stinks.  I want to be able to interface my devices without doing your lousy Samsung All Share/ now Samsung Link that makes me agree to privacy policies that promise you NO privacy, and sit a Samsung representative in your living room every time you watch the TV.  NO Thanks.*** In all fairness to Samsung, the Smart View app in the Android Play store (does let you wirelessly stream content from the TV to your device without registering.______________Why you should get this TV1.  Best picture of any TV on the market from the largest TV manufacturer on the market.  I sometimes pause the program just to look at it.2.  It is future proof.  Because it is 4K, the screen is capable of outstanding resolution for a long time to come.  There's another great benefit - the Evolution kit.  HOWEVER, this TV write up by Samsung and thus Amazon is unclear.It comes with the built in evolution Kit but NOT the One connect box.  To get that, you have to get the HU9000 model which costs more money, and has a useless curved screen.  However, the write up infers One-connect future upgrades.  This TV is One Connect READY according to Samsung.  My guess is that they will upgrade this unit and all 4K units with one, One-connect for all, but see below.3.  It really looks elegant.___________________What about this new 2014 8550 compared to last years 4K F9000?If you can save a pile of money, then hurry and get the F 9000 before they sell out.  Amazon's price and service are both good and you save around $500.  The picture, CPU, memory, everything will be the same as the F9000 which is only 5 months older, and clear motion rate is the same.  Its true.  HDTVvs.com has a comparison and the main difference is the smart hub software.  You can save $500.00 and get a 4K blu-Ray with the diff.EDIT AFTER PRICE DROP:  On the other hand, if the prices are the same, the decision is tougher, but you should probably go with the newer model even though it is almost the same.Back on the other hand, F9000 has two advantages.  The One-connect box is a separate unit that houses the CPU, memory, main board, firmware, and smart TV software.  This is better than the evolution kit in the HU8550. A true One connect box is still on the H9000, but it costs more.The One Connect box that separates from the screen itself is better because you get new connection ports, less heat build up for a longer lasting screen, and you have less cable clutter.  If you know anything about computers or electronics, you know that the CPU, memory, and motherboard generate the most heat and eventually cause the units to fail.  Mine is a few feet under the screen, you can touch it and feel the heat, although it is more of a high warm than hot.The One-connect box is a genius idea that Samsung should employ for all of its TVs, and so should every other manufacturer of high-end TVs.  The 8550 is ""One connect ready"" for future updates but for now its evolution kit is on the TV.  So it is not really a big deal either way.The second reason: The 8550 base is nowhere near as stable or as cool looking as the arch base on the F9000.Although the 8550 model does do 4 screens, this is not with 4 channels, but 4 different inputs.  Which isn't really needed.  Updates to Smart hub are superfluous compared to the F9000.Bottom line: Both TVs are spectacular and as soon as you get new one connect boxes, they will be the same.  Be sure to set it up right and anyone you show this TV to will pick up  their jaw off the floor. You will love the picture and the features.  You will also save big time over the HU9000 with its gimmick curved screen.Hope this helps you enjoy your TVBlessings",2,2,0.0061809574,0.010826292,0.9829927

"I've had this kit for about 3 months now and have used it extensively by itself and with arduino and raspberry pi projects. It came with everything as advertised. Everything has held up very well except the mini servo which broke after only one use. All in all though, this was a great kit to get started with and has a nice assortment of components.I decided to write this review due to the responsiveness of the seller. I contacted the seller regarding the thermistor and requested a data sheet so that I can actually measure temp with it accurately. I got a response in less than 24 hours with an uploaded PDF datasheet.

"I have a Garmin StreetPilot C330 and had it mounted in the car with the suction-cup cradle that comes with it. To my annoyance the suction cup would lose its grip after a while and sooner if the temperature outside changed drastically.I got so fed up with having to put the darn thing back up on the windshield the round marks it left there that I decided to research the alternatives. I hate buying after-market/third-party accessories for anything I own...mainly because they almost always fall short of my expectations. Hence it was only natural for me to try and find out what Garmin itself had to offer.This Dash mount was the best logical solution right off the bat. I was a bit skeptical in its ability to hang onto the dash when making turns because the actual ""legs"" don't seem to have much of a grip when you inspect them closely. As it turns out, I was wrong.I have had this Dash Mount in my fianc&eacute;'s car for about a year now and it has worked flawlessly. Once you have it on the dash, you can rest-assured that it will NOT move regardless of how many sharp turns you take. Unless of course you pick it up and put it down in a different spot.The quality of the product itself is top-notch and it is much more aesthetically pleasing than its suction-cupped counterpart. Additionally it is much easier to adjust the viewing angle of the C330 while it is in it. I personally think that Garmin should ship out all its GPS Navigation units with THIS mount instead of the usual suction-cupped ones.For anyone who is considering or already owns a Garmin StreetPilot, I would strongly suggest getting this right away. Trust me, your experience with your GPS will be much smoother.",2,2,0.001180749,0.008404633,0.9904145

"This is a ""Home Theater in a box"": and it is a pretty big box (around 70 lbs).  As this was sold for what I consider a very modest price and included free shipping (which was a sweet deal considering the weight) I was not expecting much.  I had auditioned some other setups from Bose and Klipsch prior to purchasing this.  Those systems cost more money and had limitations that I found troubling.  I was in for quite a surprise.  This little setup rocks.  You can't expect miracles with such small speakers and subwoofer, but this thing way over-delivers.  We had it set up in a fairly large room (> 300 square feet) with over 20' ceilings and it had no problem filling the room with sound.  Surprisingly good value.

"This is a great addition to any computer setup. To be able to use photoshop with it is astounding. It is intuitive and creative and makes editing photos super easy! There is a little lag between when you do something with the pen and when it shows up on the screen (this is most noticable with the sketchpad program it comes with) but I think it may have something to do with the processor speed of my computer. So, if you have a newer computer with a better processor than mine it should not be problematic. By the way, the sketchpad program is a lot of fun... and not just for the kids either. The price is a little hefty in my opinion. For about $200 you could get a lot of cool toys, but if drawing and editing pictures are your thing then this IS the product (again, in my opinion)...

"I do not have stock in the company and I don't normally rate things at 5 stars. This is a fine product. When I opened carton, I immediately saw an excellent ass'y guide, all parts packaged very nicely, and all parts were absolutely super quality. The manufacturer has 800 support and spare parts are easily obtained. The glass shelf is very high quality safety glass with the nicest center mounting hub I have ever seen. The screw hardware is tops. I used this shelf to mount a Sony 8&#34; Trinitron CRT TV that still has the best picture I have ever seen. I collect vintage sets, and this shelf allowed me to mount the Sony to be an extra screen in my family room along with my flatscreen. I also use the Sony as a switchable security monitor. The shelf has a substantial load rating of over 30lbs. It is very sturdy. Now, here's the fine print. You MUST find a stud behind your drywall or plaster. Even with paneling, find a stud. I suggest you use an electronic stud detector. The single arm is secured with sizable lag bolts that you need a metric socket and socket wrench with extension, to install. A power drill is needed to do starter holes.. Drill pilot holes of about 5/32&#34;. When you install the very large wood screws, make sure you don't drill too big a pilot hole. You want the screws going in very tightly. The bracket plate goes up first. Then you attach the arm with a very large machine screw and a special locking nut that will not back out. You need large metric sockets or open end adjustable wrench and maybe a Channelock wrench. Tighten so arm is hard to move. Next, attach the glass shelf with 3 Allen head bolts to the arm. There are stick on cushions to keep set from slipping on glass. Here's is my additional item- I suggest you buy a long Velcro safety strap to go around tv or your device and the shelf. This is just added protection to prevent a device from galling off the shelf especially if you have kids in the house. This shelf is great for DVRs, sat boxes and whatever you have. Buy a quality cord concealment system and you have a great addition to your home. I also forgot earlier. There are two nice plastic covers that snap on and conceal the workings of the shelf. If mounting on solid concrete, and NOT MORTAR, you have 2 plastic anchors supplied. I, being the older guy that I am, prefer transitional pound in pot metal concrete anchors instead. You don't want this shelf landing on your head.",2,2,0.00034999894,0.0010013207,0.9986487

"I bought this on a lightning deal, figured I take a chance on it for the price in spite of the reviews. It's for my son, so we could get rid of the old behemoth TV he had in his room.

"I've been buying Sony TVs for more than 30 years, and they rarely disappoint. The 40"" Bravia is no exception. Last year I bought the 70"" SXRD model for my living room, and the 40"" is for the bedroom. Many televisions are high quality and prices are dropping, so why get the Sony?Picture quality is excellent, especially in high def.Sound quality is very good without a home theater setup. Not always the case with flat panel TVs with small bezels.Remote is well laid out and easy to use (although it does lack backlighting, but I have no trouble finding the buttons I want in the dark). It's easy to change between the 4 programmable picture settings or screen aspect ratios. Sleep timer button is right up on top when your ready for bed and is in 15 minute increments.It has 2 HDMI inputs for easy connection of compatible devices and several other inputs. You can customize the display to choose between only the inputs you are using and label them appropriately (so it's easy to switch between my TiVo, DVD player, TV and cable box, and hide the other inputs)There's a zillion other settings that I haven't figured out all of yet, but most are relatively intuitive (except PnP, which has me baffled so far).I got the flat panel LCD because it uses less power and generates less heat than a plasma, and won't burn-in (although plasmas have improved). The screen doesn't reflect as much, and has a wide viewing angle.For viewing from about 6 feet, the 40"" size is perfect.Lots of other things I could say about this TV, but it's all good. You can't go wrong with this model. Also highly rated in Consumer Reports, the consumer's bible...Amazon shopping tip: Amazon offers price protection for 30 days from date of purchase. After you buy this, put it in your cart again and check your cart regularly for a month. The price goes up and down almost daily. When you go to your cart you will be notified of price changes.

"This camera takes excellent pictures and videos. The pictures are sharp and clear and with an f1.8 lens, you have the flexibility to take low-light photos with no flash. Built-in ND filter allows for longer exposures in bright sunlight. I use mostly the Aperture mode, but there are many other options for creativity available. You have the option to shoot in RAW, jpeg or both. The optical viewfinder is very useful when shooting outside in sunlight. This is one of the main selling points of the camera.Far too many digital cameras that purport to be high-end models only have an LCD viewscreen available. If you can't frame what you are shooting, it makes it much harder to take a good quality shot.I also have several full-size DSLR's that I use, but in instances where I know I will walking a lot and don't need the extra zoom, I take the G15.Video quality is also excellent. I shot about an hour of video that edited down to a 10 minute video. Picture quality was almost indistinguishable from a dedicated video camcorder. The only time I noticed any difference is a shot where there is a lot of fast motion. In that case, there was some slight pixelation when I slowed down the video speed. But unless you are shooting fast-motion sports or racing, you won't see any degradation in video quality.I love this camera for it's flexibility. I don't have to carry a heavy DSLR and I don't both a camera and a camcorder on occasions when I shot photos and videos.

This is for photographers who want a good camera- not something you shove in your pocket.Good work Canon!",2,2,0.00035461332,0.0012574054,0.99838793

"Got the 512GB OCZ Vertex 4 on the Black Friday deal (over $100 off) for use in my 2007 17"" Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro running OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.2.  Hadn't ever opened that MacBook Pro, but found good instructions on the web and had it installed in no time (Torx T6 was a bit hard to find, but The Shack had it).  Firmware was already upgraded to 1.5 so I didn't have to mess with that.  Plugged my old drive into a Seagate GoFlex adapter and was able to copy all of the data as part of the OSX install procedure.Haven't done any specific tests, but it is blazingly fast.

I used to find myself listening for the hard drive to make sure the computer was working, but now it just does what I click on -- and the Vertex drive is silent anyway.

When it was apparent the laptop was dead, they reimbursed me my purchase price of the laptop with no qualms.  I shipped the laptop back and they sent me the check.  About the only thing I would like to see them change is that I had to send back the hard-drive with the laptop.  Fortunately the hard-drive was fried and the data was not retrievable (checked on another laptop).  I've had warranties through other companies on new computers and they did not want the hard-drives when a device was sent in for repair or return.  With all the id theft going on, I would rather they give the option to opt out on the hard-drive warranty coverage for computers.

"We purchased this so that we could occasionally use our 7 inch tablets as GPS when traveling.  The suction cup holds well.  The positioning options are enough.This mount has been adapted by Arkon to hold small tablets instead of 4-5 inch GPS units.  One half of the tablet back plate is rigid and attached to the mount.  The other half is spring loaded and slides out of the rigid half.  On each half, there is a grove that hold &#34;fingers&#34; to actually hold the tablet.  The groove allows the fingers to be moved to avoid ports or buttons on the tablet.  The fingers seem very light to me and exhibit flex.  Fortunately, Ankers sent an extra set of fingers for this unit to allow adjustability for larger or smaller tables.  I installed the 4 long fingers on one end and the 4 short fingers on the other end.  This seems to eliminate much of the flex and it looks strong enough to me.I am satisifed with the mount.

It will pick up all the stations you need. I also switch to using the AMP the antenna came with. Works great and gives off less heat.I attempted to use one of the coat hanger antennas using the designs available on youtube.com. It worked great, but one day I lost ABC and PIX11. I moved the antenna around for hours and nothing would work anymore...While I was at Wal*Mart, I picked this antenna up to try out. I placed it where I had my current antenna (In front of a window) and hooked it up to the AMP I already had (18dB). This antenna worked immediately.I now have full strength (maybe to strong) on NBC, FOX, CBS, moderate ABC, PIX11, PBS, ION. I have several other channels, but I only watch local channels.This antenna is small and very light, like others have stated the cable that comes out will knock the antenna down if moved. I placed the kick stand on it and placed it on the window ledge. Looks great and the wife likes it over something bigger.I believe a lot of other people have issued because of placement. I already spent several hours finding the right place in my room for the antenna with my previous one. so for me I just plugged this in and it work.I would give this antenna a try, if it doesn't work just return it. Remember, the point of the antenna is to save money, it may not always be 100% prefect, but at least you're not having a monthly fee for your channels.NOTE: I am not going to use the amp provided since I already have one, it'll be my backup in case something happens.PS.

I would definitely not recommend this 17"" cooling pad for a 17"" laptop, as it just barely fits my 15.6"".  I would get the 19"" stand for anything near 17"".  Hope this helps.UPDATE:  1-27-12I've had the product for about a year now and the fan has begun to make a noise (it sounds like the fan is slightly hitting a part of the encasement).  I removed the fans, cleaned them and did my best to secure them so the noise would stop.  This works for about a week and then the noise reappears.  I heavily used the fan for about a year, so that may be the reason, but I would have hoped that this product would have lasted for more than a year.  It still works, but the noise is such a nuisance that I will need to purchase another fan.UPDATE:  6-25-12The noise associated with the fan has disappeared and is working like a champ again.  Whatever happened, the issue seemed to have sorted itself out and I couldn't be happier.  Not sure what cause the unit to make the noise, or what happened to make it disappear again, but this issue could be isolated to just me.  Just wanted to update in case you were worried about the noise.",2,2,0.01035873,0.08652611,0.9031152

"I am so pleased with these guys, I ordered the iphone 5s screen protector but since we did not like the headphone I asked the seller to mail me the HTC One instead. The seller shipped me the new screen protector without additional cost and I returned the iphone screen protector.Now coming to the product. The screen protector is AMAZING, I am a long time ZAGG Invisible shield customer but I am soooo please with this product. The HD quality maintains the screen sharpness unlike ZAGG Invisible shield. Although ZAGG is very durable but it does have a rubbery feel to it.Now compared to ZAGG HD Screen protector this quality blows it away in quality this is far far superior you literally feel as there is nothing on the phone at all. Time will tell how it holds up for scratches but as far as the quality and installation goes and the seller service I am extremely happy. I think this is a decent price for a SP there is no point spending $25+ on just a SP.

"When i came to buy a case for my Fujifilm E550 there was only 2 option on this brand, Rezo 30 and 60. Since somebody said Rezo 30 was small for a Canon A70 (which i know is likely the size of the Fujifilm E550) i decided to buy the Rezo 60. When i got it on my hands i realised it was too big for my camera, at least 30% bigger. I really like the case to fit the camera like a glove, like the Rezo 20 did with my Fujifilm A303.

"I've owned the G10 since it came out late in 2008. It has many great features for those wanting a point and shoot, but also like the ability to use more advanced tools, including shooting in raw format. The camera is very well made and sturdy. As an avid photographer, I use other canon cameras, including the 5D, but I love the G10 when I don't need a full size camera.I can shoot in manual or full automatic. The camera takes great photos in nice lighting, particularly in day light. One of it's weakest features is in low light or when you are using a high ISO, actually I try to avoid over 200 due to degradation of image quality.The batter life exceeds all expectations. I can usually get over 400 photos, even when using the LCD screen regularly.Definitely worth looking at if you want a durable, more advanced point and shoot.I used this on a cruise vacation and carried it everywhere.

"I had bought my first camera, a Pentax, in 1965 and graduated up to the Nikon family. Being immersed in black and white processing for years and needing a new camera I weighed getting a new Nikon and all the darkroom equipment necessary for color processing.Since I am a photo hobbyist, I was unable to justify the expense of the equipment plus having to buy a new set of lenses. The Sony Mavica with its SLR viewfinder capability struck me as an ideal compromise. You are able to actually view what will be taken while the LCD allows those surreptitious candid people shots.It is great being able to down load pictures into my iMac and manipulate color balance, crop, and electronically 'dodge' the darker areas to achieve what your mind's eye saw when taking it. The Sony supplied software is a waste of a CD, though. Get Photoshop to really use the capabilities of this camera.There are a load of features which make this camera ideal for both portraiture and landscape photography. But it is also eminently suited for those quick snap shots.Having a true 10X optical zoom with a compound lens lends itself to nearly any situation . I rarely use the digital zoom although, with its higher than average CCD size and pixel count, little resolution is lost.All in all, a great camera for the ardent hobbyist as well as the casual user. It will have longevity in the digital camera field.Okay, there are two detractions to an otherwise great product... the manual leaves much to be desired and the battery charge connector is very touchy.",2,2,0.00050954486,0.0023744756,0.99711597

"First I want to thank Tim Kimzey ""fstop"" for his review. His review gave me enough information to order this case. I am using it with the X20. At $16.xx it is a great deal. Keep in mind this is a $16.xx case, so do not expect $100.00 Fuji case.Fits my X20 almost perfectly. I have ordered a 40.5mm to 52mm step-up ring hoping to use the 52mm filters I already own. Just got 40mm to 40.5mm step-up ring 40.5 filters for the camera. The part of the case that goes over the lens is a little off center, so even though I can drop a 52mm lens cap in and it fits I do not know if the step-up ring, a filter, and a lens cap will fit. I really hate the OEM cap and it is bulky in my pocket. Wish Fujifilm used 40.5mm the standard filter size, would really help with a wide choice of filters are 40.5mm.PROs: looks great, fits very well, and does not attract undo attention. This is important to me as I do not like to wave my camera out like a red flag to someone who might try to grab it. I really wanted to get a light brown case but they are a little to showy for me. They look great, but I do not want my camera to grow legs.NEGs: the cover for the lens is a little off center which may preventing use of 52mm step-up ring. Inside felt not completely done right, very minor imperfection which may just be on my case.For $16.xx it does its job very well, as one reviewer did a follow up after seven months I expect this to last a long time.Added a 1/4"" Male to 1/4"" Female Screw Adapter for SLR Tripod Camera, it is nice that I no longer have to take the camera completely out of the case.

Coupled with an older Denon DVD/SACD/DVD-A/CD player, the sound is terrific.  At one point, I swapped out my much more expensive Yamaha surround sound receiver, but it didn't sound as good as the STR-DG810.  I got the Sony on closeout at Circuit City for $180.  Great deal for this quality sound!I don't use the HDMI ports, only the 2 channel analog inputs and the optical Video 1.  The Sony is my primary music listening unit.

Great product. You must use quality batteries. Cheap ones are not recognized and show bad.  You must have at least 1.35 v charge and acceptable internal resistance to work in this unit. I have Panasonic NiMH from 1994 that were refreshed and work fine.  I also have newer generic &#34;digital&#34; Wal-Mart ones that fail. They work but are not.optimum and only charge in a dumb charger to 1.4 volts. The internal resistance is nog correct and the unit analyzes them as bad. I have new and gently used eneloops that work and refresh fine.So.buy with confidence and use good batteries. 2200 nah is about all you want for longevity and fit. Larger capacities have short positive buttons and won't fit in many devices. 2000mah last me over 10.years with proper care.  I am an engineer so my test equipment is quite sofisticated. N Lee's reviews tell it all so I won't repeat his info.2200.capacity as took 6 hours to cycle and come to full charge. Let's face it they are batteries. Chemical storage units. Knowing every detail won't change the fact that a cell is poor or good. Buy well and they last. I usually never refresh NiMH. Only NiCd. EventuLly the chemicals neutralize and the cell is dead.

We took that to mean that the set was fully charged and went to work.But that's it for the negatives!Now for the good stuff:-They fit perfectly on your ears, like ear muffs and you cannot ear sound outside of the headphones while you're using them, huge bonus.  They are foam and adjustable.  The sound quality is amazing, very crisp and clear, no air/wind noise, none of the rustling clothing noise, very professional sounding.-The microphone moves in several different ways so that you can fit it just for you.  This is a big help if one family member is a child and then their big daddy wants a try, they headphones will fit him too!-Plug & Forget - there is a tiny leave-in nano receiver ready for use. Plug it in and leave it and it will always be ready to go.-Loud & Clear - laser tuned drivers minimize distortion so you can enjoy clear calls and stereo sound while a noise-canceling microphone reduces background noise.  This works GREAT if you live in a big family with a lot of children or dog (or both) running around!-Unleashed audio!  You're not chained to the desk, you can move freely up to 33 feet (10 m) from your computer with no problems or distortion of your call.-The six hour rechargeable battery lets you chat longer, whether you're at your desk or on the move.We're sold, they are perfect for chatting, gaming, VOIP phone calls, whatever you'd like.  My son tested his voice with Audicity to get a reading on how well it filtered out background noise and he said it was rock steady.  So now he will be able to complete his projects without any distractions from the rest of us :)We'll definitely be buying another pair, these are great!!",2,1,0.088481784,0.46330333,0.44821492
Great device.  I connect to it with my cellphone bluetooth and plug it into my computer so that I can use it as a speaker phone for my cell phone or skype/googletalk.

"I am a professional sports photographer. For my basic needs, this bag is great. I used it just last night to shoot a hockey game.

But for a basic 2 body 3 lens job this bag seems great. Some people have identified as a weakness the fact that this bag doesn't cary a camera with lens attached. I'm quite sure that wasn't the designer's intent. If you're a street photographer looking grab your camera in a moment's notice then this bag is not for you.

"I have owned this radio for about two months now, and I am very happy with it. I live in a rural area and I am very particular about the radios I own because of the weak radio signals that beset me here. I am, therefore, pleased to say the C. Crane CCRadio-EP excels at receiving AM signals, with the distant station that carries my favorite baseball team's games coming in strong and clear. It is nearly as sensitive on FM stations, too, with my preferred NPR stations coming in very clearly. Despite the fact that it has analog tuning, it holds onto signals very well and doesn't require constant retuning to keep faint stations properly tuned. Sound quality is very good for a radio of its size and it has bass/treble adjustment, too. Sound is not quite as full as my GE SuperRadio II, but it is slightly better than my Sony ICF-EX5MK2. The bottom line is that the sound is enjoyable for both music and the spoken word. Concerned about QC, I ordered my C. Crane CCRadio-EP directly from Crane and it has performed admirably. I have no complaints about the build or material quality of the radio. Battery life has been good so far, as well.I would recommend this radio without hesitation to anyone who is looking for a portable radio that offers excellent reception and very good sound quality.

"I'm a fan of the Manfrotto Quick Release. More so than some of the other styles of quick releases like the Arca Swiss versions that require you to screw something in tight. That's just not quick to me. There are still issues with this though. It can get caught or stuck and you'll want to make sure it's in nice and tight otherwise you might need to give your insurance company a call. It's a cheap enough system so that I can always use a few of these to make any travel tripod or monopod or selfie stick all operate on the same Manfrotto plates. This is really convenient. The downside is that sometimes the screw just needs to be re-tightened as they start to come loose from the camera body.Randomly. you shouldn't take these underwater. In the ocean.

It's certainly not slow, but I was a little surprised to see that number at first (my fault for not researching like I should have).

I received these RCA on ear headphones a few days ago for my son. He currently has some Coby over ear headphones that were more money than these so I figured this would be a good test. The RCA headphones have better mids and highs than the Coby for sure. The bass is about the same. The overall construction of the RCA headphones is better and more comfortable for extended use. The single cord seems to be durable and should last. Please note that they not high end headphones but a really good buy compared to some other brands out there. My son loves them and thinks they look cool so I guess that is all that counts.

"I have one of the standard Leaf version and one of the Leaf Plus powered version.  I've been experimenting with both of them in two rooms, in different locations in each room.  These are both *impossibly* terrific!  I've tried plain old rabbit ears, amplified and non-amplified ""HDTV"" antennas, antennas with motors in them to rotate the reception field...I've lost count.  Some cost easily twice what either of these costs.  BUY THIS THING, either the powered or unpowered model, and start experimenting with placement.  Placement is the biggest performance variable for either model.  I am looking at a station I can't even begin to get with the powered version in room A, but it's as clear as digital cable in room B with the non-powered version.Finding a way to position it has been a problem but easily fixed.  Search Amazon for ""menu card holder"" and you will find lots of options.You must try this if you want to dump your pricey cable company.

If you don't know if your motherboard has a PCI slot, then you probably shouldn't be buying something that goes into a PCI slot. Simply, you do not put a screwdriver in a socket that calls for an Allen Wrench. It won't work, and you shouldn't expect it to. You buy the things that will fit with the system you have.

"The Logitech keyboard fits very nicely on the Ipad 2 using the magnets to make a tight secure fit.  As a cover it protects the screen very nicely. But it offers no protection at all for the back of the Ipad. I find the thin leather cases provide a bit more protection.  But if you are looking for a keyboard that acts as a protective cover for the screen the Logitech works nicely.The keyboard cover has a built in rechargeable battery that recharges with the included USB cable.  Once charged, the user guide indicates it will operate for about 6 months.  To use the keyboard, you have to take the cover off, and insert the Ipad in the tray-slot in the cover.  It holds the Ipad at a nice angle for typing or for watching a movie.  The keyboard has decent tactile feel.  I did find the keyboard a bit tight.  I would not want to type on this for very long.  The Apple wireless keyboard is much more comfortable to use ...but it is 2 inches wider.The Logitech connected easily with the blue tooth on the Ipad.  I did not have to enter any security codes...it was recognized and worked easily.If you want a keyboard built into the cover, then by all means get the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard.

"I just started getting strain from my right hand/arm area while playing Torch Light 2.  I never had strain or RSI/carpal tunnel symptoms before even with marathon hours of World of Warcraft.  On Windows 7, it was basically plug n play.  For me there was a short learning curve (like learning a new controller) but so far I've been able to play without pain and fairly well.  I really, really like this product and plan on switch between this and a normal mouse (both can be plugged in simultaneously) so I don't overwork my hand/arm in a single position.The mouse glides easily across my mouse pad and although there is no scroll wheel there is a scroll button; by squeezing the handle your mouse cursor will transform into a scroll cursor.  This works well for me even if I prefer a scroll wheel.  As others posted, the buttons seem fragile; although expectantly responsive,  I'm concerned in regards to the longevity of the buttons.

"I am very impressed with this keyboard. As a stand and a keyboard is works great. The keys are very cramped so forget about touch typing unless you have very small fingers, but as long as I keep my eyes on the keys I do pretty well. It uses Bluetooth and plays well with others, so having it and my Logitech Bluetooth speaker connected at the same works fine. I love having the entire screen minus a bit of real estate at the bottom, where suggestions are still shown, available to view the app I'm writing in. I can type much, much faster using this keyboard than I can with the one on the screen.As a cover, though, I'm undecided about how well it works. It snaps on securely, is easy to remove, and seems to protect the screen, which is great. But I've also had some problems where I've removed it and the screen is somewhat unresponsive. I don't know if the cover caused it or if there's another problem with my Nexus 7, and I still use the cover, but I am wary.I also have the official Nexus 7 stand, which charges the tablet. This keyboard does NOT charge it, though, so even though you can plug your charger into it (and you have to in order to charge the keyboard's battery), you will still have to charge the Nexus 7 separately or keep the charger plugged in while using it. If you have the Nexus 7 stand, you could  just sit the keyboard in front of the charging Nexus 7 and that works fine too.Unlike some of the reviewers, I haven't used the keyboard enough to wear the labels off the keys, but from what I can tell it's well built and works better than I expected it to work. I'm happy and recommend it to anyone who could use a keyboard.",2,2,0.00040768785,0.0024918264,0.9971004

"I'm a nature photographer. I take a lot of photos, and the files are big. I carry a laptop in the field, but I'm not so naive as to think the laptop's drive is safe for irreplaceable data like photos. I want backup. DVDs are impractical. Flash drives are too small (so far). The Western Digital 500GB is a highly acceptable solution to the challenge of managing copious data and not sacrifice portability or ruggedness. And if you are concerned about TSA seizing your laptop for whatever reason, then you've got your work intact.I use the drive in two ways: I back up my Aperture digital photo library directly, and I backup the RAW files via the Finder. As others have noted, the read/write speed is only adequate. But 500GB fits in a drive only slightly larger than my iPhone. For $99 - the cost of a year of Mobile Me - you can have a pretty decent backup to carry in another bag. The drive draws power off the USB bus, so you have just the drive and the cable. As a bonus, the cable is identical to the cable I use to pull photos off my camera.The drive has worked at 14,000 feet in Papallacta Pass, Ecuador. In the steamy, muggy Amazon jungle, at near-freezing temperatures on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, in the rough waters of the Gulf of Alaska and everywhere in between.No, I wouldn't want it for my desktop.

"Love the set, No issues so far. Replaced a 24"" Dell (1980 x 1200) Monitor which, although it had a DVI input didn't support HDCP. The 32"" display spreads out the 1080P a bit more, so it isn't as sharp as a monitor as the Dell - Not surprising at all. But the display is very nice, and my older eyes appreciate the larger fonts. The TV features of the set are great, as to be expected with a new Sony. The Internet apps are okay - really too many to count, and many are of the ""WTF - who needs this?"" variety. Netflix works fine, but the search/select functions could be better. Some Sony apps are still locked up while they clean up their data breach.

"I purchased the glossy Garmin Nuvi 3590LMT GPS to replace an earlier Garmin whose voice navigation was so poor I had to scream at it to be heard.  The new GPS was a delight, improved in every way but one 'glaring defect'. The GLARE. Glossy and sexy in the store, it proved unusable once in the car environment, the capacitive glass screen being so shiny that it could not be seen in ANY bright environs. I immediately returned it.Then I got on the web and found the earlier reviews on this Lexerd protector, and they impressed me so much I repurchased the GPS, purchased the Lexerd protector from Amazon, and voila!  The protector completely transformed the GPS from unusable to outstanding. It fitted exactly (some early reviewers said it did not, but this had been corrected -the fit was perfect!), the non-glare surface simply eliminated fingerprinting, and the touch and swipe action was smooth as silk.With this protector attached, the Garmin 3590 now becomes the best 5"" GPS you can buy.  Better even that the newer one Garmin replaced it with, having returned to utilizing a non-glare screen.So if you see a great deal on the 3590, do not hesitate to buy it, because with the Lexerd protector, it is fantastic.NOTE: Lexerd brands this package as 'crystal clear', leading you to believe it is not non-glare.  That is a packaging/branding error, the product I received was very much non-glare.  But they do also produce screen protectors for other devices sold as 'crystal clear' which have a very different surface, including one for the iPad Mini that has horrible glare and on which finger swipes stick like flypaper. Hopefully Lexerd will fix this in the future.But in the meantime, buy this protector for the Garmin Nuvi 3590 with confidence, and enjoy the view.",2,2,0.07312817,0.05594911,0.8709228

"I love this speaker. It's a beautiful design. The bluetooth connection holds up well up to 25 feet away through 2 walls. It's plenty loud and has a surprising amount of bass, almost too much. The connection port is a bit flimsy, but that's to be expected for a universal device. Once docked, the phone is solidly secured to the dock. It takes a non-trivial amount of force to remove the phone from the dock, meaning it won't ever get knocked down accidentally. It can be a bit hard to connect your phone to the dock at night since there's no physical guide into the USB connector, but this would be a probllem for most universal Android docks and there's not much that can be done about that other than turning the lights on. You get used to the positioning of the USB connector and it gets easier to connect it at night by feel. The adjustable night-light is a great feature (I wish it was a different color though, maybe white to match the clock display instead of orange), and the white-LED clock is clear and legible both at night and during the day without being blinding. On a hardware level, it's near-perfect for the price.However, the Philips DockStudio software is really buggy. You have to physically plug your phone into the device for the connection to be made. The app automatically launches whenever you connect your phone to the dock, and a persistent notification is displayed. Dockstudio crashes a lot, sometimes it tries to open two instances of the app, and it doesn't really add much functionality to your phone other than allowing for the standard bluetooth connection.The interface is unintuitive. The settings are sometimes forgotten. Upon my initial download, there were several mis-translations. Luckily, the software never affected playback once connected, but it does cause frustration when the app freezes and slows down your phone. I've never used the software much because of that, and there are much better alternative apps that replace the features in DockStudio (weather, clock, internet radio, YouTube playback)..For reference, I'm running a Nexus 4 with stock Android (4.2 up to 4.4). There should be absolutely NO REASON for a company like Philips to have buggy software on a device running stock Android, especially one that is emulated in the Android SDK and that is part of a line of phones that was developed for us software developers.Overall, I love the speaker, and it works very well for the one thing I wanted it for, which is to play music via bluetooth. Otherwise, Philips should be absolutely ashamed of DockStudio (at least in its current state), and ashamed that they have yet to make any substantive updates to fix these issues months later.",2,2,0.00034237275,0.0016326745,0.99802494
"I've had many computer mice over the years, but since I started my own business over 2 years ago, I've been on the computer about 60 hours a week. That kind of schedule is pretty hard on the computer hardware and peripherals - especially the keyboard and mouse. The Logitech M310 is the only mouse I've found that fits my hand perfectly (important since I've had carpal tunnel issues for years), provides the perfect amount of support to my hand and wrist when used with a wrist-rest mouse pad, and doesn't eat batteries every other day. I can put a battery in this mouse and use it for months - never turning it off - and it holds up for about 3-4 months. (I know, I know - I should turn it off at night, but I usually forget.)I have used smaller versions, like the Logitech M185, and found my wrist immediately hurting when using it - it's just not big enough to prevent strain to my wrist. The M310 is perfect, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wireless mouse.

"I have been a committed Jawbone ERA user... and prior to that, a Blueant Q2 user.  Sound quality is a big deal for me.The ERA has a slightly more full sound quality than the Finiti.  However,  the in-the-ear-canal intrusion of the Finiti ear piece brings a significant level of acoustic isolation from ambient sound and  provides a very good sound quality...there is nothing tinny about it.Cancellation of background noise is at least as good as the ERA. People on the other end of a call indicate they hear none of the background radio sounds or office sounds or wind noise that are often prevalent on my calls.Bluetooth range is substantial,  although I have not measured distance. When the Finiti goes out of range of provides a warning.  When it comes back into range of reconnects automatically.Very comfortable fit. Can easily wear all day without even realizing you have it on.For less than $50.00, I was skeptical about wasting my time trying the Finiti (I was ready to pay 3 times that amount,  again).

"I bought theGarmin n&uuml;vi 265W/265WT 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Trafficafter my Nuvi 855 was ripped off. I couldn't justify laying out the cash twice.I'm really happy with the 265WT. Nice size and shape, the audio is clear, and the display and presentation is nearly perfect. The 265WT has all the major features of my 855, AND it includes the lifetime traffic service. I had my doubts about the value of the traffic feature, but I've seen it in action a few times. It was a significant add-on to the price of the 855, so the 265-bundle price is great.This bundle covers only one update, but that's fine: roads don't really change that often.I've had the 265 re-plan a route several times without telling me, resulting in a bit of lane-changing at awkward moments. Now, I'm not sure whether this is traffic input, or finding a marginal benefit as it gets closer to the decision point, but it can come as a wee surprise.Just for grins I downloaded the Garmin cycling team manager's voice. It's a bit of fun; the GPS makes odd cycling-related comments randomly with an Australian accent.

"My Garmin GPS IIIs (I have two) were growing a little long in the tooth.  I knew the new Garmin devices had much better lock-on times and the four AA batteries in the ""III"" don't last long.  I also wanted something smaller and lighter.So, I bought a Garmin Dakota 20.  Then I bought the Garmin North America City Nav microSD/SD card.  Installing the card is a no-brainer (the directions come with the card).Then I downloaded Garmin BaseCamp software.  Why?  Because it is free.  Fortuitously, during the process, I was prompted to update the Dakota's software, which I did. (Do this before you record a lot of stuff, it erases your stuff.) BaseCamp will import tracks and waypoints from the Dakota.  It will also create and export waypoints to the Dakota.  It may do other useful things that I will learn later.  The map is very basic.I prefer Street Atlas.  Street Atlas will import waypoints and tracks from the Dakota directly to a much better map.  Expert GPS will also import the waypoint and track-files from the Dakota.The screen on the Dakota is small but useable.  The screen is a little dim, but that is not a problem unless you want to mount it on the dash of your car.The two (alkaline) AA batteries in the Dakota look like they are going to last a lot longer than the four batteries in the GPS III.  I have been playing with it for several hours, over two days and the battery icon has not changed.The manual leaves a lot to be desired.

The advantage of using wifi on the 5Ghz frequency  over the old 2.4Ghz frequency  band (b/g/legacy n) is that it is super fast (up to 857 Mbps bi-directionally vs 130/300 Mbps), has 2-3 times the range, is less crowed, and is highly stable.High end routers achieve their speed by using several bandwidths (20/40/80 Mhz) and channels within those bandwidths simultaneously and by 'beamforming' (an algorithm that focuses radio power to a particular device). Note that forcing the DECT phones ensure security hopping across bandwidths and channels.Technically the wifi and the DECT transmissions shouldn't overlap, but I found a very loud clicking, sharp crackling, and near constant static on my DECT headset to the point where it was nearly unusable.The issue was in my home office I have multiple wireless devices in one room. A printer and iPhone3 on 2.5Ghz (g/legacy n) , an iPhone5 on 5Ghz (n),  two wireless laptop network adapters on 5Ghz (ac), and a DECT headset base. All sorts of radio beams were being focused in the room and saturating all frequencies, bandwidths, and channels.Solution... on the router I set the 2.4GHz frequency to use just the 20MHz bandwidth and reduced transmission power to the lowest possible before devices drop off. In my case, I dropped the power from 200mW to just 35mW. The 5Ghz frequency continues spread across the 20/40/80 MHz bandwidths at full power (200mW) .

"Crimps nice, makes good solid connections, gigabit over copper with custom length cables super easy... These are well worth the money. Perfect for the pro, and the serious home network DIY'er. I will need a few more bags of these for some deploy jobs I have coming up... Will buy these again. Would have no qualms using these in a customer installation.For the reviewers that are crying that these don't hold into a port. Pull the latch tab for Pete's sake! When you crimp ANY RJ45 type crimp connector, the latch tab gets crimped with it. Tug it out a hair (I shove my pointer finger under it), and they will, and DO seat well... Your crimp tool has a LOT to do with whether or not your latching tab gets smashed town too far as well. I have the TrendNET crimper and haven't had problems with it. A prior crimper I was using that looked identical to the TrendNET, just no name on it, smashed the tab every time...I am on my 4th bag of these, 3 were bought through work, and one of them is mine for personal projects.

"Let me preface this review by saying I have a Canon SD750 which both my fiancee and I LOVE and have owned for about 4 years now.  However it has been dropped many times and doesn't quite work the same anymore, although in proper lighting it still takes amazing pictures.  Having said all that, there are a few flaws that really nagged me about the camera which the SD4500is fixed.Now for a few thoughts on the Canon SD4500is.1)  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, use this camera in the AUTO mode.  I'm not quite sure how they ever let this camera get released with the AUTO setting the way it is.  It literally takes at least 5 seconds or more for it to decide how and when it wants to take a picture.  And when it does the pictures come out terrible.  When I first opened up the box and took out the camera, I tried taking a picture of my Christmas tree from about 4-6 feet away.  Well the camera came out of the box with the AUTO mode on.  I pressed the button to take the picture... and waited... and waited... the camera tried its hardest to focus, then the picture went all blurry until it was just huge blobs of lights and tree, and then it finally snapped the picture.  The picture was just horrible.  I later realized that for some reason the camera was trying to take the picture in the ""macro"" mode, which doesn't make sense at all and is probably the reason the picture was big blobs of lights.  Anyway to make a long story short, when shooting almost anything, the AUTO mode seems to take way too long and screws up most of the time anyway.  Don't use it, just use the middle mode, the picture of the camera on the switch on the top of the camera.  The regular mode works perfectly fine.2)  I read a few complaints about the start-up time for this camera on the reviews here.  Let me compare some times for you.  I did a quick search online and found an online stopwatch and timed the startup times for my old SD750 and for the new SD4500is.  The startup time for the SD750 was 1.5 seconds.  The startup time for the new SD4500is was 3 seconds.  So its about double the time.  It seems fairly quick when you are starting it up but the fact is its about double the time than my old camera.  Right now I don't see it as such a big deal but maybe when I miss that once in a lifetime shot b/c of the extra 1.5 seconds I'll think differently about it.3)  One of my problems with my old SD750 was the lack of Image Stabilization (it usually took great pictures anyway but it would have helped in several different picture-taking scenarios).  Well the new SD4500is has it and it seems to work great, all the pictures in well-lit areas or with flash come out very clear.  Big plus for the new SD4500is.4)  Now for the money feature, the feature you SHOULD be buying this camera for or else you might as well just get the $100 Canon powershot.  The 10x optical zoom.  Yes, its real, and its fantastic.  The 10x optical zoom takes really nice pictures and the zoom is usually more than enough.  My old SD750 only had a 3x optical zoom I believe.  So basically anything after that it was hit-or-miss on whether it'd take a clear picture or not.  With the SD4500is you don't have to worry about that, with the zoom your pictures will be clear.5)  Size DOES matter.  Our old SD750 was nice and small, lightweight, you could fit it in your pocket and just go.  When I ordered the new SD4500is, I was afraid it'd be a lot bigger.  Well it is bigger, but not as much as you'd think.  Its still small enough to fit in your pocket.  I was pleasantly surprised, to the eye it almost looks to be about the same size as our old camera.  The punch this camera gives you for its size is simply amazing.  Pleasantly surprised in this area.6)  Look and Feel.  The new SD4500is does feel a bit heavier than the older SD750, but its not going to be a problem.  It sort of makes it feel more solid and expensive if anything.  The SD4500is looks great.  We bought the brown color because it was the cheapest ($270 on amazon at the time), and my fiancee was worried it would look stupid.  But when it came we were both pleasantly surprised, it looks better than it does in the picture in the product description.  Its a nice deep brown color, the back is lighter.  The whole camera looks nice though.  The back of the camera has what looks like a 3"" widescreen lcd display.7)  Button layout.  The layout is similar to my old SD750 but with some improvements.  The separate video record button is a welcome addition.  The button for just viewing your pictures is also great (I've seen other cameras where you have to turn a dial just to see your pictures and it gets really annoying).  I also love having the option to either press the dial button or turn/rotate the button.  Pressing the button can get annoying after a while, especially when viewing photos you've just taken.  Turning the dial is much easier and intuitive.8)  Features.  There are a ton of photo-settings on the camera, you will probably use less than 10% of them.  One feature I love is the ability to control the flash.  With my old SD750, I could only choose for it to be on AUTO or OFF.  It was so annoying not to be able to put it to ON.  Well with the new 4500is you can choose AUTO, ON, OFF, or some other low-light option.9)  Low-light Pictures.  I've seen some reviews on here and blast the low-light pictures this camera takes.  I tried the low-light picture-taking setting (with the flash OFF) and the reviews are correct, the photos come out grainy and not quite in focus.  Or maybe just grainy.  Either way they're not that good.  Forget using the low-light option.  Either take the picture like normal with the flash off (which come out a little better), or turn the adjustable ISO to 800 or 1600.  This lets a bit more light in but is quick enough to take a nice picture.  The pictures don't come out perfect but they seem to be about the same or better than my old SD750 would take with the flash off in low-light conditions (with the ""high iso"" setting).  About as good as you can get from a pocket-digital camera in my opinion.  If you put the ISO any higher you will need a tripod or set it on a table or something to get a clear picture.  So in summation this camera CAN take pretty good pictures in low-light conditions, you just can't use the low-light setting because then the pictures come out terrible.Let me add this.  With the flash ON in low-light conditions, it takes great pictures.  Flash is amazing.10)  Macro Mode is great.  Just like with my older Canon, this camera takes great pictures of things really really close up.11)  Battery meter.  Even though I've heard the battery life is pretty bad (I haven't drained it fully yet as I keep stopping for the night and throw it back on the charger), this camera has a BATTERY LIFE METER!!!  Thank god!  My old Canon sd750 did NOT have this feature and it drove me crazy.  With my old camera, all of a sudden it'd say ""low bat"" and then turn off a few pictures later.  There was no warning!  With this camera you can at least see the battery life going down and adjust accordingly.  Great feature I wished my old camera had.12)  Video.  I have only shot about 15 seconds of 1080p video, I hooked it up to my LED tv for playback and the picture is great.  I took the video inside, the area was lit but not well-lit.  Sound is really good and I didn't have those focus issues other people were talking about (although I only took 15 seconds of video so...).  I have a feeling their issues came from either having it in AUTO mode or using the optical zoom in video mode.  I will take more longer videos and get back to you guys on this issue...13)  Pictures.  Overall the pictures seem to come out very good.  I've only used the camera inside so far, I will use it outside and update my review.  The pictures seem to have good color and come out clear.  Many reviewers talk about it not being ""crisp"" enough.  Honestly I am undecided on the whole thing.  They don't really seem to come out ""soft"" to me, but I also haven't taken many pictures with the camera either.  I will take more over the weekend and update my review.  As of now the picture quality seems just as good as my old SD750.  One thing I did notice is that the pictures on the lcd screen, the color is slightly off.  For example, I took a picture of myself against a white background with the flash off.  The white background looked a bit yellow-ish on the lcd screen, but when I viewed it on my tv it looked white.  So I'm not really sure whats going on here, I think the color on the lcd is slightly off which people may have noticed and figured the camera took poor pictures, but as long as they are correct when printed or transferred to your CPU, then who cares?  Like I said I will take a ton more pictures and update my findings.Summary:Bottom line is that you are spending the money on this camera for the 10x optical zoom and ability to shoot full HD video.  If that's not why you are buying this camera then I suggest you get a cheaper one.  Having said that, its well worth the money for the extra zoom and HD video if that's what you are into.  Some of the features (such as AUTO mode and low-light setting) simply do not work.  But you don't need them anyway.  I will take many more pictures and videos over Christmas and update my review.  I just had to write this now because I see all the bad reviews about the picture-quality and I felt I needed to write this to clear some things up.UPDATE 12/26/10If this is your first camera and you didn't know any better you'd be very very happy with this camera. But most of the negative reviews are from previous Canon owners that have been spoiled by great quality pictures, and honestly I'm not sure if this newer and more expensive camera gives you as good a picture as my 4 year old Canon SD750 that has been dropped on rocks and had sand in the lens and the lens-cover has been broken off and it STILL takes great pictures. Although after having that 10x optical zoom of the SD4500 in my hands, its hard to let go... really hard lol... but its all about trade-offs i suppose.One of the most important factors was my Fiancee was just not sold on this camera and that was basically one of the more important reasons in returning it. But other than that, we use the camera 95% of the time for taking regular pictures, no zoom, no video, just pictures. And so I'm strongly considering just paying the extra $100 and getting the Canon S95 as I haven't seen anyone complain about the pictures that camera takes. We end up taking a lot of self-pictures (where I stick my arm out with the camera and take a picture of the both of us) and supposedly the S95 has a wider lens which is better for those type of shots. Not to say the SD4500is doesn't take good pictures, but for the money we're spending we want to have piece of mind that its taking as good or better pictures than our previous camera, we don't want to downgrade in the one area we are mainly going to use the camera for. Also the battery life factors into it as well, by the time you spend the money on extra batteries and the hassle that comes with making sure you bring an extra battery everywhere that just piles on you know?So I guess that would be my final answer. If you are in love with the 10x optical zoom and 1080p video, get this camera because despite other reviewers it DOES take good pictures as long as you don't have it on the stupid AUTO setting. The SD4500is doesn't take the best low-light pictures but I geuss you could call them passable. Also the slow-mo video is pretty cool and funny. But if you're like me and you've been spoiled by a previous camera that took great pictures, and you're not that concerned about all the bells and whistles of this camera, either spend the extra $100 and get the Canon S95, or if you're not as concerned about low-light picture quality then save yourself some money and get the $100 canon P&S;'s.",2,2,0.01894286,0.092000335,0.88905674

"I am a former Nikon D50 owner, I abandoned the camera because I started carrying much smaller Sony DSCs I could simply slip in my pocket. I still miss the D50 after all these years, even if the Sony DSC line only got better. This Nikon 1 J1 replaces my current Sony, a DSC-HX9v.For starters, this is not a point and shoot. The automatic modes are nice, but they won't do anything you can already do with much cheaper point and shoot cameras. That said, if you are willing to do the work and learn the camera, you will be rewarded. I am really happy with the pictures I am getting, but it took me weeks to get used to it.Ergonomics:The camera is basically a slab, it doesn't have contoured edges or soft grips. I find it really comfortable, it fits in my hands just fine but some will get nervous at using this camera without a wrist strap. I only used the strap that shipped with the camera for a few days until I received my Gordy strap, which works extremely well.I like that it is pretty much impossible for the camera to power up just from sliding within a case, unlike the Sony DSC-HX9V which did this all of the time. There's a downside to this, it is very hard to find the power button by touch (the camera will wake up if you have a lens with a lock button and you engage it). The shutter button is exactly where I expect it, unlike again the Sony.Camera body/controls/etc:This camera is beautiful, it draws a lot of attention, which may be the opposite of what you want. I imagine the silver and black bodies from a few feet away will look like any other camera, but the white version just stands out too much. The fit and finish are really nice, I am not a fan of the pop up flash but it works. The flash cannot pop up unless you unlock it manually.The bottom door for the battery and memory card access has a decent latch and has yet to open accidentally.The cover for the micro HDMI and USB is hard plastic, no idea how log it will last if you actually use these cables a lot. I only used them once to test the HDMI cable.The back controls are extremely simple, they took very little time getting used to. The main command wheel does NOT include PASM, those are accessed through the shooting menu. The main command wheel actually looks kind of naked, since it only has four modes.The second command wheel has a nice texture and the spinning element has a notch action, again a nice touch.Lenses:I bought the kit with the 10mm prime and the 10-30mm VR zoom. I spent a lot of time agonizing over this choice, but I am really happy that I got the prime instead of going for the kit with the two zooms. The only downside is that the prime doesn't have VR. As part of a Christmas promotion Amazon gave me a free memory card and a remote, the remote came in really handy while I was learning to get used to the 10mm prime, since this was the first time in years that I was shooting a camera without built-in optical stabilization and/or vibration reduction. After a few weeks I got the hang of it and shake is no longer an issue, it was just a matter of unlearning bad habits I picked up from spending so much time with point and shoot cameras.The 10-30 is a sweet little lens. It is very small, and it has a lock mode that allows it to collapse for storage. This means that the camera is not really that much bulkier when carried with the 10-30mm than with the 10mm prime.My personal preference is to keep the 10mm on as default, unless I know I will be shooting video or that available light is not going to be an issue. I am dying to get my hands on the 10-100 VR lens, which right now costs as much as what I paid for the camera, the 10mm and the 10-30VR.Pictures/Video:The pictures are disappointing if you are expecting the camera to do all the work. It pays to dig into the manual and venture into the PASM mode, it was a lot less painful than what I expected. You can do some really impressive work with PASM modes with really little work. I wish I could do more than +/- 2EV adjustments, and it won't let me auto bracket, but except for those two things it has been a joy to shoot. Also, with the sound effects muted it is completely silent, which is awesome for candid shots.As for the autofocus, it is as fast as advertised. My only issue with the autofocus was while shooting video, and I am not done experimenting with the different custom settings for that.Two of the auto modes are more for show. There is a mode that will shoot a very short video and then freeze at the end, and it adds some background music. There is also a mode that shoots a high speed burst, then tries to pick the 5 best pictures of the batch. This mode is slow and cumbersome, to me it is mostly as a way to demo the capabilities of the camera.The plain vanilla auto mode is decent, but creative types will soon end up leaving it set in one of the PASM modes instead.This camera cannot shoot 1080p video at 60p, it either does 30p or 60i. At 720p it will do 60p. You can also shoot fast speed videos at either 400 or 1200fps, which are encoded to be played at normal speed and yields some interesting slow motion effects. I have not had issues posting these videos to Youtube but I noticed that the Xbox 360 channel for Youtube won't display the high speed burst videos.Conclusions:This is not a camera for a newbie, or somebody that spends most of the time in full auto mode. Think of this as a camera for somebody that would rather have a DSLR and a dozen lenses but doesn't want to lug all that gear around. I actually freaked out when I realized that I could have had a Nikon D3100 and the 18-55 kit lens for $150 less, but in reality this is the form factor that I needed, I don't like hauling around a big camera.Also, keep in mind your color choice if you would rather blend into the background when taking pictures because the white camera attracts a lot of attention (I imagine this is going to be 10 times worse if it is the pink one). I doubt anyone will blink twice at the silver or black versions.",2,2,0.067850366,0.33215058,0.5999991

"This is my first Blu Ray player and so far I love it.  Set up was not too bad, although the instruction booklet is not very helpful - not sure what all the pages are wasted on, but could definitely include more step by step instruction.  Wireless connection was easily established - I use a Mac and Airport Extreme, no problem.  The picture is beautiful and sound is great.  Netflix streaming also worked very nicely - no interruptions and very good picture quality.  A few picky points I don't like - the disc drawer doesn't seem to close when you gently push on it like most dvd players do (including an old Panasonic dvd player I have). This is not a big deal, but you have to push the remote or the top button. The power button and the disc drawer button are on the top corners of the unit, not on the front. I have another component sitting on top of the player, so that doesn't work so well.  The remote seems pretty easy to use and the buttons are reasonable size (some remotes have tiny little buttons crammed together).  The on screen menu is a bit awkward - figuring out how to change the weather panel to my local area was trial and error.  Most people probably realize this, but if you're buying your first blu ray player most (all?) do not come with the necessary HDMI cable, which can cost you quite a bit depending on the quality.

"This speaker has quite a unique look to it. I don't imagine seeingt his thing from afar that you would think it's a speaker. It looks more like an egg. Anyways, the sound is good. For the price, the sound is really exceptional. If you go into the Apple store you'll find some comparable speaker docks like the yamahas and then iHomes etc.. This one has a wireless remote that you can scroll through songs, adjust volume, play, next, back, mute, and other controls that uaully come standard. It has a bass equalizer with 6 levels of adjustment. It would be great with a treble equalizer, but still the sound is pretty darn good. The sound fills a room pretty easily. If you are looking for an iPod speaker dock for the living room or family room, this one definitely fits the bill. It's heavy on bass, so on acoustic music I find that setting the bass level to about 3 usually sounds the best. Otherwsie when I listen to electronic music on it I like it at about 5.

"Everything is relative. Some people complain about this lens: too big, too heavy, plasticy, not sharp enough, etc. However, this is a must-have and the best compromised lens for certain types of shooting.In fact, it is smaller than I expected, considering the huge range it covers, though it is not light. I use it on D700/D7000 and it balances quite well. Some people use it as a walk-around lens. I am a short guy and may opt for a lighter one (50mm, 24-85mm, i.e.) for street scene or casual shooting. Compared with the DX 18-200mm, it is heavier, bulkier, yet better built; the zoom is tighter and less susceptible to creep.What would I use it for? When I can only carry one lens and don't want to miss a shot, close-up or far away. If you are doing fast-paced, journalist-type of shooting, or strenuous hike up 8,000 feet of mountains; you can't afford the time to switch lenses, or have to conserve the weight you carry. This very versatile lens gives you the freedom to shoot from close-up detail/portrait to wide-angle landscape. Imagine photographing a street festival, and suddenly you want to take a picture of a child's facial expression without putting a camera in his/her face! How about photographing a blooming alpine prairie and suddenly spotting a fox walking away?If you enjoy the DX 18-200mm, then you will appreciate this 28-300mm even more; it is very sharp! However, using on a DX body, the wide angle becomes almost normal (42mm) and the tele end extends longer (450mm). In fact, it is surprisingly sharp, even comparing to the pro lenses. Use common sense on aperture though. No lens is sharp from corner to corner wide open. Furthermore, the VR is a great help! It enables me to take sharp picture when my hands shake a little or when the lighting is less than sufficient (slower shutter speed).For such a super-zoom, I believe it offers more than its value, and its versatility outweighs the shortcomings. The Canon's equivalent lens costs way more yet the IQ is way less. To me, any distortions or color infractions, etc. can be corrected afterwards with software. Sharpness is something can't really be fixed. Professional photographers usually prefer the primes, or the Nikon ""Trinity"" zooms, which give tack sharp pictures. They usually dislike super-zooms, such as 18-200mm or this 28-300mm. However, dollar for dollar, this lens lives up to its intended functions and sharpness.One last thing I need to mention: many people, including me, detect an ""unusual"" noise during auto-focusing. It has been described as hissing, chattering, buzzing, ""electric transformer on a rainy day"", ""tiny beads rolling down a test tube"", etc. It is not loud but noticeable. A few people said their copies are silent (or poor hearing?). Some people exchanged for 2 or even 3 copies and the noise still exists. Some people sent their copies back to Nikon for inspection/repair, but got ""not a defect"" in return. The general concept: it is believed that the noise maybe ""normal"", due to the new SWM mechanism. Indeed my copy auto-focuses fast and dead on. Thus I tentatively agree with the assumption.",2,2,0.00031568907,0.0029947057,0.99668956

"I really like the radio and LOVE the price! Purchasers of these radios assume responsibility for following the laws of their areas and it's very easy to step over the line with them, so a bit of research and caution is well advised. Believe it or not, I don't plan to transmit at all. I programmed the radio (after gaining a lot of knowledge with other radios and software) to receive local public service frequencies, along with the CTCSS settings to filter out the lousy intermod (bursts of unwanted crosstalk trumpeting over the speaker) that police scanners are notorious for, and this works fantastic for that. Something the BF software allows (in fact requires) is to program transmit frequencies separately from the receive frequencies. So to prevent accidentally transmitting illegally on a police frequency, I set transmit to an FRS channel at low power, which is about a half watt and within legal limits (not to say it's legal to use a non-FRS-certified radio on FRS channels, but in the off chance the mic gets bumped, it's better than interfering with emergency communications).",2,2,0.007642512,0.033079356,0.9592781
I purchased these to supplement the high end frequency response of a set of Left & Right compact speakers in a 2.1 home theater system in my daughter's room. What attracted me to these  tweeters was the variety of mounting schemes. I placed the tweeters on the back surface of the L/R satellite speakers so that they would project into the wall/ceiling and disperse high frequencies into the room without 'beaming' directly at the listener. These tweeters made an improvement to an inexpensive set of compact corner-mounted speakers.,2,2,0.0011309619,0.0034214985,0.99544746

"Does as it describes. This mouse works on every surface I have tried. The scrolling is smooth, you won't feel any bumps in it. The  back and forward buttons are placed kinda weird in a way that I am not used to. I usually don't even remember that they're there. The only things I wish was that; 1) The button to pop out the receiver was bigger, and 2) The mouse would turn off automatically when the receiver was placed into the mouse slot. I was used to my old Microsoft mouse turning off automatically when I put the receiver in. It's not a big deal though. I don't know what the battery life is like yet. They included an AA battery and so far it still has power. I bought this mouse to use at school on wood tables. Overall, I really like this mouse.Edit: The left and right click are a little loud. Sometimes it disturbs people in the library. Also the smooth scroll wheel doesn't work so well when zooming in on photos. I also encounter some problems with clicking the middle button.

"It has been awhile since I've tried a stylus for my ipad. I was sadly disappointed with the sensitivity and the amount of drag I felt as a moved the tip across the screen.

"Update: I've had the machine for 13 months, after paying the 2 and a half grand premium price.  After the disappointments mentioned below (including the hard drive model from Amazon that arrived DOA), I had yet another crisis: I dropped the sharp, slippery machine, putting a dent in the upper left-hand corner of the cover.  I should have notified Apple right away, but it seemed to work fine, so I let it go.  Soon the notorious hinge was beginning to come apart and disintegrate before my very eyes.  Apple has accepted responsibility for the defective hinges and is replacing many without charge.  But since the dent was obviously my fault, the liability was totally mine.  I went to two Apple-certified repair places.  The first was the pits, immediately condemning the machine and then not giving it back to me reassembled until I requested (and paid for) it.  The 2nd place was more encouraging but still a negative--I was only out postage.  Finally, I received a recommended repair place from the Apple site.  It wasn't cheap, and they had to charge me extra for things like the missing screws that the first Apple repair place didn't replace despite charging me for reassembling the machine.  But the 3rd, Apple-recommended place got the repair in at under a thousand, which is about 40% of what I paid for the machine from Amazon new.  When I received the Air back after a couple of months, I knew I'd made the right decision.  I had been using an iBook and a Macbook, but both seemed like clumsy behemoths compared to the Air.  (I also tried an Acer Netbook but couldn't see getting anything done on it for serious editing.)  So try to tell me this machine is a rip-off or merely a stylish fetish.  So far, it's the most practical, useful machine I've discovered for those moments when you're doing serious computing away from your desk.  The trick is not to drop it.  Also, I'm on the lookout for an even lighter, faster, cheaper Mac Air with decent battery life, since the Air is the only computer that actually motivated me to write.  Know its limitations and advantages, and understand what your requirements are, and it's easily a two-thousand dollar machine compared to anything I've seen remotely resembling it.]{[After six months' use: I'm still in love with the machine, despite all of the naysayers (family and friends) who warned me about its ""limitations.""  Only disappointmentS so far: 1. The battery life is no more than a couple of hours with the bright screen I prefer; 2. The audio port is too cramped to accommodate most audio mini cables (be sure to look for plugs that don't widen at the base); 3. Apple's dropping the price by nearly a third soon after purchase still hurts.  (Don't even consider the non-solid state model at the current price difference.)  Look for Apple to lighten this up even more, add speed and memory, extend battery life, and lower the price.]Some of the ""elitist"" owners of this machine would have you believe that it's intended for some sort of exclusive club that's willing to sacrifice functionality for style.  The fact of the matter is that the new solid state Air is where Apple is headed with all of it laptops.  Especially given the mixed consumer reviews of the new Macbooks and Macbook Pros, you may wish to give this one a longer look--or at least wait for the price of solid state circuitry to come down to a more attractive level before springing for a Mac notebook.I tried a Net Book but ultimately found it too cramped to accomplish the serious work all of the included programs (esp. MS Word) implied it was capable of.  Then Amazon came through with a serious price break on the ""other"" Macbook Air, the one with a conventional hard drive.  It was a nice objet d'art but arrived DOA (admittedly, mine was no doubt an exceptional instance).  The solid state Air has twice the memory as last year's model and at a slightly reduced price (too slight to put it within range of most of us, unfortunately). But Amazon's enticer of free two-year financing finally proved too compelling.This machine must be awfully good if it can win me over after two major disappointments: first,  Amazon's sending me a (much) less expensive model that arrived DOA; 2nd, Amazon (or, rather, its Store Card Bank, which appears to be run by G.E.) refusing to extend me the no-interest credit offer (maybe they're looking for customers who will be likely to default on their payments, in which case ""no-interest"" is no longer not in the customer's interest).  In any case, the display shows beautifully (no Shinola, and no requirement that you be in exact alignment with its brightest part to be able to read it).  Moreover, even though the weight specs suggest it's no lighter than a small Net book, it ""feels"" lighter because of better distribution of that weight.  And it's so thin, you could use the edges for cutting your Danish each morning.If you want a mean and lean writing machine, look no further (unless it's out into the future for better prices).  If you want an entertainment center, complement this one with a desktop model or iMac.  My experience has been that once I start using the laptop to burn CDs and DVDs, watch movies, record and mix live music, etc., it soon becomes cluttered with programs and files and hangs up on me, going berserk with kernel panics.  I haven't had this one long enough to proclaim it crash-proof, but the absence of a CD drive along with gratuitous firewire and numerous other unneeded ports is encouraging and strangely liberating.[One small caveat: I'm not sure what the claims are re: battery life, but it's looking to be no better than that of previous machines--a couple of hours.  Beats me how Apple can get a 32 gb Touch to go forever while the laptop Air remains comparatively fuel-hungry.][Six weeks later: it's going strong, and frankly the reported ""slowness"" is something I don't notice.  It's plenty zippy--and I'm someone who easily becomes impatient.  I've since had my broken 2007 MacBook repaired (the excuse to pick up this machine), and I can honestly say the Air has completely spoiled me.  The MacBook feels like so much dead weight compared to the nifty machine I'm now using.  In fact, I plan to sell the MacBook on Amazon and stay exclusively with Airs henceforward.]",2,0,0.45331866,0.12627669,0.42040467
"I purchased this set to replace an older, corded keyboard and mouse.  I chose this model because I wanted a USB-only connection and I liked how small the Bluetooth USB transceiver looked.  I must say that I am extremely impressed by this set!  Not only does it work flawlessly, but both the keyboard and mouse are extremely comfortable!  I also love the re-designed scroll wheel.  It has a smooth, yet firm scroll action.  Plus, the added side scrolling makes it even better!On the down side, I had a little trouble at first in setting it up.  But to be fair, my configuration is not the norm.  I have 3 desktops and 1 laptop connected to a switchbox that includes USB switching.  So, as I switch from machine to machine, the Bluetooth dongle switches with it.  The problem I ran into was when setting up the keyboard because the directions say that you have to use a passkey for the keyboard.  While this may be desirable for security purposes, I will tell you that it is no requirement.  As soon as I switched the connection to use no passkey, the switching between machines worked great!  There is only a slight delay of about 5 seconds each time I switch while the new machine recognizes the USB Bluetooth module.Really, I couldn't be happier with this set.

"This is one of the few kits available for the Viewsonic G Tablet.  I wanted something that would protect the screen but also provide a more solid grip, to avoid drops, and to protect overall from scratches.This kit does just that.  The kit arrived quite quickly in a plastic tube to protect the contents from damage during shipping.  Included were the screen protector, the carbon fiber panels (there are more than I expected), the solution for attaching the clear screen protector and the squeegee card.Since this requires the use of a liquid solution in order to install the screen protector, I ran my battery down to 1% in order to avoid any issues should the liquid get into the G Tablet during installation.  Viewsonic has a very tight build on this model, and that wasn't an issue for me.There were no instructions and the carbon fiber pieces were not labeled, so just take your time and test them by lining up the openings in order to determine where the side panels should be placed on the tablet.  These side panels and back do not use the liquid provided.  They are self-adhesive and, once you figure out where they should be placed, go on fairly easily.  The back panel fits great, but the panels designed to wrap around the sides left a 7mm and 3mm gap on the right side of the tablet.  Other than that, everything else lined up perfectly, and this does not create a performance issue for me.  But customers should know that it isn't seamless.If you've never installed a Skinomi screen protector, go to their site or search YouTube.  There are some great videos out there that will walk you through the process.  Since this requires a liquid solution, it's best to drain the battery or remove it prior to installation.  Also, be sure to clean your screen before installation.  After wetting both sides of the protector, you do have some time to line it up properly.  If you need to peel it back and readjust, just add a little more solution and it goes on easy.  I only used about half the supplied bottle on my installation.After squeegeeing out the bubbles as best as you can (there may be minor ones or ""marks"" from final adjustments, wipe it down with a microfiber cloth and leave it to dry for several hours.  Those will eventually go away.  I installed mine in the evening and left the screen to dry overnight.  In the morning, I was somewhat concerned with the look, but after I returned that evening from work, the screen was clear and clean.  Just give it time.Sensitivity is great and I noticed no change in performance before or after the addition of the protector.  Actually, it seems smoother to me than the original screen.  The carbon fiber adds just enough texture to improve the grip but still allows the rubber feet to grip if you're using it on a flat surface.Overall I'm very pleased with this product and will continue to use Skinomi products in the future.",2,2,0.0012638432,0.008540967,0.9901952

"I wanted something cheap to play and learn lighting, mostly to help for indoor on-location shoots at clients houses. Newborns, kids, headshots, etc. Also to use for a photobooth type set-up for events. Works great for all of this and love that it's not hot for my clients to sit under.Arrived very fast, easy to set-up, issue with one bulb and they quickly replaced it for me, sturdy enough, easy to transport on my own, highly recommend for amateaurs/beginner professionals - but I have nothing to compare it too, so do your research.Light is natural/daylight - looks good, umbrella is silver inside - not white (not sure if that is good/bad/makes no difference#, reflection in eyes looks like a propeller when close up - Will try to post examples) but worked great even though I don't know what I'm doing.Great, awesome customer service from Cowboy Studio - will buy from them again.",2,2,0.00034671457,0.0040891236,0.9955642

"Like most everyone else I didn't take buying a new tv lightly, after all you're not talking about going to the local department store and grabbing something off the shelf for $300-$500 any more. Spending up to two grand on a tv makes you really want to get what you're paying for, and there are so many options in screen sizes, options, features and even the most basic decisons such as LDC or plasma that you'd better do some research to know what you're getting into.I had been looking to replace our old 32"" tv for a couple of months, but didn't find the perfect screen size until Panasonic came out with this particular 46"" model. I knew I wanted plasma, I knew I wanted a good brand name and I knew I wanted to be able to take advantage of the features like HDMI outputs, optical outputs and various other controls so that I could easily add a home theater system later. Amazon had the best deal going at the time so I bought it, and the white glove delivery was just fine. I was happy to get it all for under $1,700 when it would have cost me at least $300+ more at any local retailer.I haven't experienced any problems at all with the tv, it was in perfect shape right out of the box and instantly confirmed that I made a good decision with the 46"". The picture on an HD channel is stunning in either 1080 or 720, and regular shows in 480 don't look as bad as I was lead to believe they'd be. The remote is very intuitive and easy to use. The sound from the tv speakers is fine, if a little flat and tinny, but I don't plan to use them much anyway. I've already received my Panasonic SC-PT960 Home Theater system and that should handle any complaints I have with the tv's speakers when I find the time to set it up. It's very easy to do, and with both the tv and the theater system having digital optical capability I'll be able to get the best sound possible from a HTiB.If you're looking for a really good buy on a plasma, you want something bigger than a 42"" and smaller than a 50"", and you want a smooth transaction and professional delivery this set deserves your attention. I really don't think I could be any happier with something else.",2,2,0.0013640298,0.0035964674,0.9950395

"I recently got the 55"" LG GA6400. Thanks to in store price matching at Fry's, I was able to get it for the exact same price as it is on Amazon (currently $1029).For non tech-savvy users, the biggest downside will be the sound quality. As others have mentioned this TV does not produce great sound. Most audio coming out sounds ""echoey"". A soundbar is definitely suggested. But let's remember, TV manufacturers are becoming obsessed with making thinner and thinner TVs. Because of this, there is less room for larger speakers. The thinner the TV, the smaller the speakers, it is pretty simple really. This Google TV isn't even the thinnest out there, but it sure sounds like it. The speakers are located on the bottom of the TV pointing straight down. You can mess with some audio settings on the TV to help, and enabling virtual surround sound and changing the audio to vivid in the quick settings helps. But again, a soundbar is suggested. My older TV, which was nearing a decade, sounded better. But it could accommodate larger speakers, so that makes sense.The TV itself offers great picture. Contrast and brightness look great even in well lit rooms. At high backlight levels, it can produce a decent amount of heat, but I find I never need to bring the backlighting all the way up. Viewing angles look good so far when viewing 2D images, but not so much with 3D. This is a common problem with 3D TVs though, so it was expected.The 2D-3D conversion isn't that great. Don't plan on watching 2D movies in 3D using this. The best way to watch 3D movies on this TV is either through a capable blu-ray player or by having a 3D movie file. However, if you use Plex you CANNOT watch 3D movies through it. For whatever reason, LG was stupid enough to not allow Plex to take advantage of various 3D formats like side by side images or one on top of another. Your only bet to watch 3D movie files is using Smartshare. And getting movies on Smartshare isn't as easy as Plex.In regards to Plex, it is probably the thing I use most on the TV. However, LG, again being stupid, gave users an old version of Plex that cannot be updated. You have to go to the Play store to download the updated version with costs money at the time of writing this. Also, the paid version currently has a bug making all non 16:9 format videos distorting to fill the screen. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.Overall UI is fairly simple. One thing I find odd is that if you want to use the scroll wheel, you can only use it when the gesture cursor is activated. Meaning if you are in Plex or Smartshare and want to scroll down a list, you have to use the buttons. If you want to use the wheel, you must enable the gesture cursor.The UI isn't completely fluid. I have a feeling this is partially because LG is stuck years behind. Some examples I can think of are switching between apps, going to the home screen, doing something simple and hitting the back button, switching between home and live TV, etc. But in all fairness, nobody has really made a completely fluid TV UI. I suspect that is why most people are eagerly waiting for an Apple-made TV set as even back with their 2007 iPhone, it ran smoother than many Android phones today. This TV runs Android 3.2 despite it beings years old. Also, LG has a video on YouTube showing Android 4.2 on this TV, which I believe they uploaded back in March. However, even now with it being almost September, LG will not tell me when 4.2 will be available on their TV.In relation to LG customer support, the people who work for them typically know nothing. I asked them about the IR blaster before buying this TV, and I was told it only supports one provider: Dish Network. However, it easily connected to my FiOS box with just a few clicks. I suspect it will work for most major cable providers and their respective boxes and DVRs.Some common TV buttons are not easily accessible using the so called ""Magic Remote."" For example, there is no easy way to start recording a TV show. You have to hit menu, press the right arrow a few times, and then the middle button. On my cable remote, there is just one button. And for going straight to live TV if you have rewinded a little bit, even more clicks are required. However, I found that the most common buttons are easily accessible.Most functions work fine. And it is great to have a remote control app for your phone. However, some functions do not work on iPhones, such as seeing a list of channels and what is playing. Some functions do not work on my Nexus 4, such as remotely turning the TV off despite this same exact function working on an iPhone. Also, with the Smartshare app on the TV, LG says to download the Smartshare app on LG made Android phones. However, the Nexus 4 is made by LG but you cannot get the app on it.Overall I am happy with the TV, despite finding so many issues with it and LG. But I came into it knowing no TV is perfect, and considering the other options available today for the same price, this really is one of the best thanks to it running Google TV. Although I am bias since my usage mainly consists of Plex.",2,1,0.09457912,0.6791788,0.22624213

"There do not seem to be many reviews for these light sets here on Amazon, and I know how annoying it is to not have any reviews to base a choice on. I got these based on feedback about SquarePerfect products in general, and they are pretty nice. The set comes in a bag that is about what you would expect quality-wise. I doubt it would hold up to hard usage, but it is not complete rubbish either. It has a rather elaborate logo stitched on the side, and carry handles that velcro together like many duffel bag designs. The parts are packed in white cardboard boxes, and in order to effectively (and safely) pack everything back up, you really need to keep these boxes and re-use them. There are basically 4 components here, repeated a few times. First, you have the stands. They are light and well designed. I don't worry about them breaking, and they have a nice feature in that the parts that could potentially fall off and get lost-the nuts and bolts- are universal and could easily be replaced for just pennies. As long at you pay attention, I do not see this as being an issue though, and all the nuts have blue loc-tite on them, which is nice. You get 2 tall stands and one short one, as shown in the product picture. The stands have universal mounting screws on top, and these ship with plastic caps screwed on over them. Note that you need to take these caps off, even just to mount the light sockets, otherwise the set screw will not fit into the groove at the top of the stand.The sockets appear to be pretty good. I don't feel nervous about switching them on... they are plastic, and although they don't scream top-of-the-line, they are completely decent in my opinion. The cords are about 6 feet long, so in order to be practical you will want to get some extra extension cords to make these more mobile.The bulbs come packed in fitted styrofoam containers, and all arrived in good shape. These are actually the most expensive part of the set, so it is good that they are well protected. The light is good for my uses, though the amount/temperature is of course subjective based on your need.This is a constant lighting kit, not a flash synced kit or anything tricky. You turn these on, and they are just ""on"". The total output is not super bright, but enough to provide a good, pleasing amount of soft light. You may want one more stronger key light depending on what you are doing, and just use this as a kicker/fill set.You get 2 diffusing umbrellas, and they seem the most fragile of the parts here. They work as intended, but I do feel the need to be careful, since the fabric is attached with a few points of thread. That said, they work fine, and the light brackets/sockets are able to hold them at whatever angle you set them without an issue.Overall, I would recommend this, unless you travel all the time and need something really rugged. At this price, I think it is a pretty good deal, and I would not hesitate to buy it again if I had had the opportunity to see what it was like before purchasing.",2,2,0.06274581,0.41648445,0.5207698

"Excellent lens that is in many ways very similar to the AF-S 85/1.4G. The look of the bokeh is very similar and absolutely beautiful. Very nice soft transitions, no hard edges. The so called 'cat eye' effect is very little. Vignetting is not bad either and easily corrected by default in camera or in post. It;s about the same with most other fast lenses.Sharpness is excellent, again just as good at the highly respected 85/1.4G (which I also use a lot). Auto focus is excellent. When shooting wide open, accurate and reliable AF is really an important issue. There is no hesitation or 'jittering' on the AF like I have seen with other lenses and especially with third party lenses. This lens produces the highest keeper rate of all fast primes I have owned. While of course it is apples and oranges (but to give you some context), shooting this lens side by side with my AF-S 24-70/2.8, I can see a clear difference. The 58 is clearly better.I've seen one review online where this lens comes in below the AF-S 85/1.4G which surprised me. Owning both lenses I can say with confidence that both lenses are equally excellent.People always compare it to the standard AF-S 50/1.4. For many people the standard 50/1.4 is a good choice and they will be happy with it. This doesn't mean this lens has no purpose.

"I did lots of research and bought this right B4 Christmas for $89. the newer version (FH20) is $30 more for 14meg. there is so much advertising for the Nikon,Kodak,Sony,Canon I was hesitant to try a Panasonic, but none of those cameras were rated that good by the consumer except this one so i kept coming back to it.I seem to buy new cameras every year because I haven't found that perfect camera. last year it was the Sanyo Exacti odd shaped movie/camera. slow between pics and its odd shape made me not like it fairly fast, no auto lens cover was a pain plus i couldn't get anyone to take pics with it because it was different from a regular camera.Perfect to me is... big screen,takes fast pics,turns on fast,pocket size, lots of zoom, bright flash, auto cover over lens plus cost around $100.I would rate this one very close to a ""5"" thus far, I have used it for a couple of weeks now and other than it is slippery to hold i really like it. battery life seems to be very good since i haven't even charged it yet.* Speed of taking pics is awesome, plus I did buy the Class 6 SD card too.* turns on fast and closes fast.* LCD screen is not as high resolution as I thought but its good enough.* i have compared the Intelligent mode and std mode and the ""IM"" pics are a little better so I suck with that. once you select intelligent mode it stays in that mode even after you turn it off which i like!* Buttons are a little small but over all I really like this camera.* Flash is bright!* Zoom is fast, can't use during movie though.* takes very good movies even in low light, did a Bday cake with candles and it looked great.* the key to taking pics is holding the button down half way to focus and then press it down.* Cute ""scene"" pics is great, it automatically puts happy birthday on the pic for you. 3 to chose from.* You have to take the battery out to charge it unless you buy the adapter, it does come out and the charger is small plus you don't have to a USB port to charge it so I'm good with that.Enjoy,",2,2,0.027277911,0.10226457,0.8704575

"I just got my first iPhone. After looking at a variety of cases including the ottorerbox, I settled on the black ballistic. The color of the rubber is flat black or matte.As a grown male, i wanted something masculine but still slim that would offer protection from drops. The hard plastic sides grip the phone and rubber sleeve tightly. The back has a nicely rubber texture and is non slip. The corner bumpers are one of the coolest features! These rubber bumper now give your phone a bounce and will take the blow rather then your phone.  They also project out from the phone meaning your phone does not make contact on any table surface face down, up, or on it side. It effectively floats.I always try to be nit picky in my reviews and there are a few minor quirks. The iPhone power plug port is not well protected by the somewhat floppy rubber. Could be a weak point with time and use. The rubber does indeed collect lint. Finally, not a negative for me, it does don't have an included screen protector. I actually wanted to apply my own so go and pick out a screen protector.I'm very pleased and find it a great value.

"I surprised my dad with this because he mentioned while shopping one day that he couldn't find plain little transistor type radios in stores anymore. He needed one for work to listen to ""the games and the races"" on weekends and didn't want to lug around a boombox. I knew I could find anything online and here it was. He works in a typical concrete and steel building where it's hard to get a good reception. It picked up all the stations he wanted to listen to, but the rest of us in the house have discovered what a good radio it is and we're all asking where it is during the week. Sure enough, someone else is using it. It pulls in more stations at a better reception than the rest of the radios we have, excluding my big vintage 8 band FM, AM, shortwave, etc., etc. radio. Even my favorite alternative and album rock stations that send out weak signals and usually totally impossible to listen to. The sound is more than adequate for what it is. It gets loud and sounds crisp and clear as long as you don't try to go too loud. This isn't a STEREO. This isn't a boombox with heavy bass. It's a little radio made and styled just like the little ones from the mid 20th century. It sounds exactly the way it's supposed to. I don't know if it's nostalgia and being reminded of playing with little radios when I was a kid in the 80's, but the convenience of carrying a little radio around the house and having one on the bedside table is just...a nice feeling. I'm going to buy one or two more for the house. Of course it's not built like the old ones from the 60's, so we know not to give it too much of a beating.

"Ok, I had a lot of trouble setting it up the day I got it.  The major reason was, I expected it to act exactly like a VCR.  So here's my tip; When you set the timer for a program, make sure you allow about 15 minutes before the program starts to put the unit into standby mode.  For some reason, it needs some time to think, or collect its thoughts before it can record your program when you exit to standby.  I kept trying to test the machine by setting up a program that would begin within a couple of minutes of my scheduling it.  It wouldn't record that way.  (This is all to the HDD)  But allowing about 15 minutes works fine.  You'll know you are recording, because in standby mode there is just a little red square lit up, (meaning timer is set.)  But when the program starts, it will act like a VCR, and the time display will change to time tracking display, HDD will light up, and DTV will light up (if you're taping DTV)  When it's done, you have to give it a little time again.  It takes about a minute to finish wrapping up a recording, then the display will just show the current time again, and even the little red square will go out.  When you go back into check your program schedule, the line for that program will be gone.  You can then click ""Titles"" on your remote and see the video thumbnail of your recording.  I haven't tried turning on the unit while it's recording yet.  I don't know what will happen if you do that.New info after using this for over a year now:  I found out you CAN ACTUALLY WATCH ONE OF YOUR SAVED RECORDINGS from the hdd WHILE IT IS RECORDING SOMETHING ELSE to that same hdd!  That, in my opinion makes it far more valuable than a VCR!  It's great if you want to watch two TV programs that are both on at the same time.  For example; you want to watch a recording of a two hour movie, but during that time it is scheduled to tape something else. No Problem!  It will record your program even while you are watching one of your saved recordings.This is all I wanted.  A smooth, easy to use, no tape hassle VCR replacement.  I put a DVD +R in the DVD tray, but I don't know if I'll ever record anything to it.  Update: I tried the DVD recorder function and it worked like a charm.  But I still haven't recorded anything to the DVD for later use, and I wouldn't know how to edit the commercials out or anything.The wiring hookup went very smoothly, the initial setup went fine.

"My wife and I already own 2 Sony mp3 Walkmans (older models) and have been really happy with their quality, reliability and performance.  The performance was awesome after I replaced the cheaper sony earbuds with some awesome Altec Lansing earbuds.  This player probably doesn't have as many bells and whistles as some others, but it has everything we need and is simple to use.  We have been so happy with them, we decided to get our daughter one of these new models.  This Sony Walkman is also very good.  The sound from the little speakers are pretty good for their size.  Louder and clearer than I thought they would be.  Obviously won't replace a stereo system, but is great for sharing music in a pinch.There are a few drawbacks that I've noticed:  The speakers are on the backside of the player, so if you want to set down your player and listen through the built in speakers, you will have to face your player down. This will not allow you to see the screen while playing and is a big potential for screen scratches.  Another thing is that the navigation buttons seem too close together.  I know they probably want you to access all buttons with minimal finger movement, but it seems too close because I find myself accidentally pushing the wrong button.  Practice may help.  Lastly, everytime you turn off this player for a while, when you turn it back on, it requires a ""boot up"" process that takes a little bit.  Slight annoyance.Although there are drawbacks, none of them affect the overall performance of the player.  If you are looking for a quality player that is reliable and easy to use, this will definitely fit the bill.",2,2,0.00041683592,0.0026454893,0.99693775

"I bought this item for my dad.  On his end, he loves it.  On my end, this is the first dedicated GPS unit and it doesn't even compete with Google Maps on an Android phone.Let's talk about how my dad likes it and its positive merits first:The unit is nice and sturdy.  We've dropped it on the cement once and I didn't have a worry whatsoever of the thing being broke.  It's light and comfortable to hold.  My dad has really liked having a unit to use for GPS rather than using my mother's co-piloting skills.  They like it and that was the goal of the gift.  Also, the 5"" screen is the way to go.  Anything smaller (especially for those whose eye sight want won't be getting any better) and it would just be cumbersome to use.On its issues:I've been using Google Maps on my Android phones and they are fantastic.  The screen resolution is over twice as high and my phone is almost as big making it more pleasant to see.  In addition, this Garmin's screen is a resistive screen where use must press down with pressure to get a response compared to my phone that is capacitive (the screen that is commonplace among all modern touch-screen phones).  This resistive plastic screen, however, is much much sturdier than my phone I don't have to worry about the Garmin breaking as discussed.  Pinching to zoom, different map overlays (such as satellite), and having 3G connectivity that is found on a phone just can't be beat.For those who have the option of using an Android smartphone (over 3.5"") I don't see the use of this device.

"I love the system and it's capability of handling up to 16 cameras!  It comes with 8 color cameras and 60 ft BNC cables for each camera. 60 ft is an adequate length for most homes, but if you have a two-story, you may need to purchase additional wires or extensions.  I have a two-story home and 60ft will not be enough for a couple of runs. Before attempting to install outside, I connected all cameras and powered up the DVR.  A monitor is not included in this price, so you must have your own computer monitor.  I am using on a 19"" LCD monitor.  I connected all cameras and they worked well.  Motion-sensor capabilities worked flawlessly.  Any activity/motion triggered immediate recording.  I have climbed into attic and other crawl spaces to determine how I will run wire to a central location in my home.  I would love to connect to my new TV because then I can monitor all cameras by turning on my TV.  (TV must have PC interface). so the process of installing externally is still underway, but at least I know everything works out of the box.  I only have one complaint about this internal/external system.  The video and power supply to each camera is exposed.  None of the wires from the camera install are housed within the camera assembly or mounting hardware.  The wires are fully exposed and can be disconnected or cut.  Especially if installed at street-level, someone can easily climb up or get on top of something if you install at the roof line or gutter area.  On my first level, the roof line is at 9-10 feet height.  Someone can easily cut those wires and defeat the system.  Hopefully you are able to record who walks up and tries to cut.  Night view is pretty good out to 30-feet or so.  For this price and the quality of the equipment, you cannot beat the price!  I would recommend this system to all friends and family!

"Works as advertised.  Here are some tips to remember if you buy one.Read the instructions carefully and follow the manufacturers suggestions for operation closely.  A no-brainer, but skipping ahead or improvising is not helpful.You don't need to make huge motions, we found that small motions work better.Rotate the wand very slowly for the rotational tricks.  You'll find the sweet spot.Ditch the stock batteries. Remember to insert the new ones Positive side facing OUT.Don't think of this as a One-For-All replacement, instead use it for a volume and playback of your TV and media playback device. You'll probably still need your other remotes if you have a complex system, but once you break out the Wand it's party time!The command feedback system is pretty darn cool, it pulses the number associated with the command you're using.Bought this for my wife's birthday, initially felt I was paying waaaay too much for a basic remote, but this gift is all about the fun and cool presentation.Yeah, it costs a lot, it's harder to use than a universal remote, but you should see the look on my wife and children's faces when she uses it!",2,2,0.00095264707,0.010782239,0.98826516

"I purchased the Sony Sub specifically b/c it was cheap and had good reviews.  I must say I was not disappointed.  I purposly waited a little while after I received it so that I wouldn't still be in the ""honeymoon phase"" of the purchase.I am using this sub as a compliment to my outdoor system.  It is not specifically rated for outdoors, but I've got it in a protected environment under a porch and sitting under a bench I built around it.  You can't even see it.  People are amazed at the sound of my tiny little outdoor speakers until I tell them about the sub.  It's very nice and adds a great punch.Good things: nice level and frequency cut-off adjustments.  Really allowed some fine tuning.  GREAT bass.  I am purposly trying to omit ""for the price"" from this review b/c it is not great bass for the price, it's just great bass!  I have a POLK Audio home theater system with a nice sub.  As soon as I got this one I put it in the POLK's place and put on some music.  Very nice, comparable sound to the much more expensive POLK.  I'll admit, once you got way up on sound the little Sony just couldn't hang with my POLK, but you had to get way up there!  And it wasn't even broke in yet.  Plus, you could buy four Sony's for the price of that other sub and you'd have WAY MORE!  Unless you are planning on knocking pictures off the wall or this is the anchor for some high quality home theater room, this one will put out the bass.  It filled my 2500 sq ft. home, no problem.  It fills the back yard too.Bad things:  I had to piddle a little with it regarding the auto-on. It seemed to want a little much to get it going, but once it gets turned on, it stays there.  Kinda weird, but definately okay.  It's just at really low volumes(light background music for dinner parties), it doesn't kick on.  But once you get it on by turning up the volume a little, it will continue to play back at those low volumes.  If I'd known this before, I'd purchased it anyway.Thats it.

"I have the new silver version, and does it ever look nice on my silver Olympus  E-PM2.  The sweet spot is at f5.6 where it is sharp across the whole frame.

If you don't have such deep pockets but you want to try a fixed aperture lens, this is the one!.  I can't believe they sell such a beautiful, high quality lens with a hood included, for under $200.  Amazing!  By the way, don't be put off with the movement inside the lens when you take it out of the box.  This is completely normal.  It's NOT broken.  Once you attach and turn the camera on, it's business as usual.  I highly recommend this lens for people who have the standard zoom lens set and want to try a prime lens without breaking the bank.

"The funky color is actually a great charm, enough so that I bought two more for coworkers who also loved them. The mouse is snappy, very comfortable, just the right weight to have some heft without being tiring, and best of all, the receiver is insanely sensitive. I can use it from much further away than my previous mouse, which had to be within a few feet to move reliably. So far it's been a battery sipper, even with a lot of use, so that's a very big plus.The one really big downside: It takes absolutely forever to start working after plugging it in the first time. Windows 7 has to contact Windows Update to install the driver; if the download is cancelled it won't work, and you have to plug the receiver back in again. Unfortunately, downloading anything from Windows Update takes a minimum of two minutes unless you have a totally fresh install, so it's a big downer to sit around with a dead mouse while you wait for it to magically start working. A generic mouse driver is all it should have needed, but Logitech wanted all the fancy battery level meters to show up.

"I am a killer of keyboards. AND, since I use them so much, I'm also sensitive to good and bad keyboards.As is my wont, I read the 1 star reviews first. I have to say that I cannot fathom what these people are talking about. The short throw on the key is what makes this thing so responsive. If one's fingers hurt from using a keyboard, you're using a manual typewriter or you're doing something dramatically WRONG. The short throw and silent response suit me just wonderfully, and the keys are MUCH better spaced than on my MacBook, the old Powerbooks or the Duo series.I'm now into my fourth week with this thing. I'd estimate that I spend at least four hours a day ACTUALLY typing on the keyboard, no hunt and peck, but full volume documentation type writing.I find, so far, the keyboard to be outstanding, my error rate dropped the instant I started using it (and did my ""technical language"") and my typing rates increased significantly.In my experience so far, I can only give this keyboard my highest recommendation.Once I've had it  under my hands for 3-6 months, I'll update this review with the experiences to that date.",2,2,0.0015825683,0.00524666,0.99317074
"Very clear and powerful audio. How is it possible? It utilizes the latest technology, it stores charge when the amplitude is low and discharge when it is needed, the speaker is virtually jumping when in operation to achieve the power. One thing bad is the silicon pad for the speaker to stand on does not hold the speaker very securely, meaning if you accidentally knock the speakers, they can fall off your table and probably break. The paper cone at the back and rubber cone in front is very exposed, take care not to pierce them. The audio is very clear, base acceptable for such small speakers. If you love lossless audio without enhancement, and does not have space for huge speakers, you will love these speakers. Pricing is reasonable and the ""eggs"" looks cool.

"I have had mine for over 2 years and I LOVE this thing.  In my opinion it is a classic digital camera.  I have taken so many stunning shots with it, and when I hand it to others, less skilled than I, they take them too.  It's true, that a camera can't make you a better photographer, unless it has a superb noise reduction algorhythm, a spectacular lens, a big CMOS chip and a fast response time.  It turns on so quickly that I can leave it off and turn it on for a grab-shot, and extend the spectacularly long (530 minutes plus!) battery time indefinitely.  The only down side is that I end up keeping so many shots, well over 5000 now, that my poor drive is full!  I really love this thing.  It's been all over the world with me, contributed to high-end visual effects jobs, created truly memorable shots and therefore gifts, web content, commemorations, art pieces etc. that I will never part with it.  Find it for sub-$500 and you will never look back.  I also recommend the instructional DVD they sell here.  Moderate production value, but high instructional value.  This camera is not a simple snap-shooter if you want to make art, so the DVD is the fastest way to learn the features and refresh memory.  VERY helpful indeed.  The added feature that it uses two different memory media if nice too.  I am currently carrying 12 gigs of memory!!! That translates to something over 2,700 10mp JPEG pictures!  I will never max out.  Impressive, huh?  Well, I think so!Enjoy it!  I love mine so much.Lekfx",2,2,0.0005246525,0.0013000106,0.9981754
Well today it came in the mail and the 1st thing i did was yank it out of the box and set it up. I was really wondering how it would be with my Nikon 3100 w/ battery grip and a Sigma 70-300mm  apo macro lens mounted on the top. To me that seems like a pretty heavy set up and i wanted to check the wobble of the tripod. I set everything up  on the hard kitchen floor and walked around it and bumped it in different areas of the tripod to see if it would off set it.It seemed to be pretty study for the cheaper priced tripods out there. I have had a couple over the years and this one seems pretty good for the price. It has plenty of height adjustment ( Im 5 foot 8 inches) and seemed pretty sturdy at that height. I then checked the abilities on the head and mounting bracket. The head of the tripod swiveled fairly smooth for being what it is BUT the quick release bracket( the part that attaches to the camera) felt a little loose with the big weight on the top. You may need to add some sort of shim to tighten it up some. All n all the tripod is pretty nice but i would use caution when using out in the cold. EVERYBODY knows that when plastic gets cold it may break easy. I am planning on buying a better tripod but this one is better than i thought for the price!  OH YEAH IT COULD USE SOME BLACK PADDING ON THE LEGS(I THINK I WILL ADD SOME). OH YEAH THE BOX SAYS YA GET A MINI TRIPOD BUT IT SURE WASNT IN MINE!,2,2,0.011244309,0.088336304,0.9004193

"""Always backup your files!"" my IT guys will remind me endlessly - and they're right. My new little black box makes it a lot easier. The Seagate 1 TB portable external hard drive is compact, fast, reliable and beyond easy to use.I plug it into a USB port, the little blue light turns on, and after a few seconds it shows up as an available drive. You can add folders, drag and drop into it and out of it, even move files from one portable drive to another easily.With the USB 3.0 connection, the speed that files gets moved is noticeably faster than I'm used to, and it's really nice to be able to have it keep up with me (mostly) as I'm backing up my photos and videos.  I've moved over hundreds of high-resolution photos and several videos, and only on a couple occasions have I had to wait more than a minute for it to finish copying before I go on to the next round.It's a little thing, too...smaller than your average photo and less than an inch think. Gone, apparently, are the days when having a portable hard drive meant lugging something heavy and cumbersome around. This little guy would fit easily in a jacket pocket. And safely too - though I've already dropped it into the floor once (oops) it seems to be made of sterner stuff and still works beautifully.And then there's the capacity. 1 TB (terabyte) is a lot of data. Those hundreds of photos and several videos? I've barely made a dent in this thing's storage capacity.  I may fill it up someday, but that day is a long time from now, I can already tell.There's a principle in technology - it's best when ""it just works.""

"I picked this unit up to replace a Saitek A-100 system that had skyrocketed in price after I fried it due to a power adapter mismatch.  Unlike the Saitek, this personal system comes with a power adapter (no identification on it, so it would be prudent to label the device it's intended for).  The sound from its lightweight speakers is at least as ""present"" and loud as the Saitek unit, though bass frequencies are slightly more muffled.  The Cyber Acoustics Portable is not quite as ""grip friendly"" as the Saitek's narrow, flatter design, which is also lighter overall in weight when used with batteries, employing 4  AAA batteries as compared to the Cyber Acoustics' 4 AAs.  Nevertheless, the Cyber Acoustics Portable can slide into a jacket pocket with little problem other than excess wire (see below).Even though the Cyber Acoustics comes with power adapter, it lacks the fold-out stand that made the Saitek relatively stable when used on a desk top.  Especially when not weighted down by the 4 double-A batteries, the Cyber Acoustics is prone to tip over and move around on a flat surface with little provocation.  Also, the power adapter pin doesn't seat deeply or securely in the speaker unit, causing it to come loose with moderate movement of the speakers.The cable to the player is permanently attached to the speaker, which could save the frustration of searching for a misplaced mini-cable.  The downside is that it's a good 5 feet, more than you need (or want) when transporting the speaker with your iPod on walks around the block or when your player is in close proximity to the speaker.  The excess cord requires some clever concealing on the part of the user.  Also, I'm not one to complain about overly bright ""power on"" lights, but this one, even though blue, is a potential migraine trigger, so best not to gaze at it.Overall, a good little speaker for the money.

"These headphones are pricey but well worth it in my opinion.I've had them for a couple of months now and have taken them on several twelve-plus mile runs. Bottom line is that they are amazingly and totally stable. They do not so much as move in my ear while I'm running. During one of my runs my MP3 player slipped and fell, swinging freely from the end of the headphone cable. And even with such a tremendous jolt, the headphones STILL didn't budge from my ears.Sound quality is very good, in my opinion. Not quite as nice on the bottom end as the Ultimate Ears I use when I'm not running, but far better clarity than I am used to from any kind of &#34;sports&#34; headset.Getting a seal can be a bit tricky, sometimes requiring that you wiggle the headphones a bit. But once they're in they're not going anywhere. The headphones come with three or four different sizes of plus and inner ear hooks (whatever the things are called that hold them in place), which helps provide ultimate customization.Once sealed they provide excellent isolation from external sound -- sometimes a bit too good if you're running in the road -- and are extremely comfortable even when you're wearing them for hours at a time. Since they touch only the inner ear, they do not interfere with sunglasses, which is another huge plus in my book.No issues so far with any kind of wear and tear, breakage, etc. Fingers crossed!",2,2,0.00028058531,0.001872276,0.9978471

"I purchased this particular SSD for my laptop, but had to return it (see below), but ended up getting the same one elsewhere for my wife's laptop. It came with Windows 7 Pro. I installed the SSD easily and then dual booted Win 8 on it. Works fantastic. Load-up speed is incrementially faster.CAUTION!!! There are two different types of SSD drives - mSATA for laptops and SATA for desktops. The former is very small (about the size of your thumb finger) while the latter is bigger (about the size of your first). Not knowing a single thing about SSDs, I was told to buy one and install it to speed up MY computer processing, so I ordered the SATA version. When it came, it was quite apparent that it would not fit in the drive, so I had to replace it with the mSATA version.I hope this review helped you.

"When I first saw the S90, I was quite intrigued by the amazing low light performance.  As a dSLR shooter, I've become quite used to shooting at ISO 800 and above with virtually no noise.  I hate the look of photos taken with tiny, on-camera flashes.  They are very unflattering so I try to shoot with natural light as much as possible.  I've had a few older, basic point and shoots and eventually moved up to the G9 but they all had the same issue: tons of noise on any photo shot above ISO 200.  With the larger sensor size faster f/2.0 lens and advanced in-camera noise reduction processing, this seems to do just fine at ISO 1250 and 1600.This camera definitely rocks.  The small size means that it's easy to keep in my pocket at all times.  My other camera is a Nikon D700 with a huge, heavy lens that I hate to take out just because of its size.  The S95 is giving my pro camera a run for its money.  The picture quality is great and the in-camera scenes give you so many options as well as full manual mode.  Shutter lag is virtually non-existent.  The LCD screen is bright and fairly accurate as far as colors.  My last Canon, the G9, had a purplish tint to the LCD and didn't display colors properly.  The S95's screen is polarized which makes it much easier to see in bright sunlight.  The downside to this is that if you wear polarized sunglasses, the screen goes black when turned horizontally.The ergonomics of this camera leave a little to be desired.  It's not easy to turn on or off with one hand and i'm always struggling with how to hold it while shooting.  I find that I press buttons accidentally.  I suppose that's to be expected on a camera that's this small.  I'm also less than impressed with the HD video.  The picture quality was great considering it's a p&s; but it is a little jumpy since it only records 24 fps.  Battery life is a little short, 1/2 a day of shooting (about 150 photos, a few >1 minute videos and some playback).  If you plan to take this camera on vacation, do yourself a huge favor and get a spare battery.",2,2,0.000823845,0.0024666793,0.99670947
"I love this Sansa e260 4GB player. It looks great, works great, and is easy to negociate even for a not-so-young and not-so-techno-savvy person like me.  Overall, a wonderful player at a better-than-ipod value. I also really like the way it downloads music so easily from my Windows Media Player.  It's a piece of cake. One thing: I don't know if I have funny-shaped ears, but the earphones are really hard to fit and keep in, and they hurt after awhile.  I don't know why they can't make better fitting, more comfortable earphones.  So I bought the JBuds ear buds, which sound great (maybe better) and are so comfortable!

"OK. First off.  This is not a Takahashi Sky 90. It isn't an Obsession UC22"" Dobsonian. I own both of the aforementioned scopes.  Plus a Tak FSQ106EDXIII. I am an amateur astronomer.  Heck, I even have my own domed observatory in the back yard. So I didn't expect this little scope to afford views like I was accustomed to.I bought the scope for my neighbors 8 year old son. But before I passed it along to him, I decided to try it out on the Heavens. Out of the box I was far from impressed. Sure, it is only a 3"" reflector. But the optic problems it was plagued by were enormous. The eyepieces are crap, sad to say. But worst of all, the optic train is even worse, at least my model.Most reflectors have the ability to collimate the optics. That is, align everything with respect to the eyepiece.  This scope does not. No way to move the primary mirror, and only ""fake"" alignment screws on the secondary mirror. On top of all this, the secondary mirror (the mirror that reflects the image from the primary to the eyepiece) was installed crooked.  This definitely didn't help any.First thing I did was remove the secondary (small) mirror from the focuser and re-glue it so that it was lined up better.  This was done by ""eyeballing"" but it made a vast difference in the view. Easy to do with some contact cement. This is about all you can do to help the optics in this little scope. This may have just been my scope, but I didn't have time to send it back.Once I made this change, I was impressed.  Remember, you're not going to get Hubble views out of this scope.  Even after the fix there was a lot of astigmatism and coma in the eyepiece.  Stars showed lots of pincushion artifacts just outside of the center field. But when I trained the scope on the Orion Nebula, there it was! With a bit of averted vision (not looking directly at the object, but sort of off to one side) I was treated with the classic nebulosity. The Pleiades were brilliant, and I was easily able to make out the shape of the Andromeda Galaxy. Jupiter's four big moons were obvious, though the cloud bands took some imagination (but there was light thin clouds disturbing my view from Earth). The Moon was very impressive.  Even when I changed to the 4mm ocular, the Moon showed lots of detail that should make any kid bubble with joy. The craters were very impressive. Though I did not see myself, I am sure the rings of Saturn would be easily visible.I remember, as a ten year old, looking at Saturn with my brothers 60mm Sears refractor. I was enthralled and it set the stage for a life long desire to explore the Heavens. Since then I've owned an Edmund Astroscan and 6"" reflector, two Celestron C8's, a C11, a home made 13.1"" Dobsonian reflector, and my current Takahashi refractors, and my new 22"" Obsession scope. All of this because of my first back yard views with a Sears piece of junk. This scope is far better in my opinion. Remember, you're not necessarily getting a top notch telescope. The build overall is impressive however. A finderscope would be nice, but I had pretty good luck just sighting down the tube and hunting. But a scope like this might just be the one thing to spark curiosity in a young mind. And there just isn't much of that going around these days.If you have a youngster that you think might like an introduction to the night sky, this is the perfect little gem. Sure, far from perfect, and might even need a bit of tweaking if you are brave enough.  But even out of the box it gives descent views of the brighter celestial objects, plus the Moon and bigger planets. And it is easy to carry and a breeze to set up. Go for it!",2,0,0.76858854,0.21701282,0.014398668

"After ordering a few more lenses, I realized that I should get a bag that fits more than just my camera. this bag currently fits my XTI (fitted with one of the following lenses), 50mm, 85mm, 28-135mm, and a cheapie fisheye setup with a 28-70 tamron lens and an opteka adapter.  It also fits my remote, card reader, extra card, lens cleaning kit, and still has room for my fuji instax mini 10 and a pack of instax film, as well as my wallet, card case, cellphone and keys.  the loops on the outside bottom nicely hold my monopod.  I also have a 580ex II flash which can fit in the case but I usually leave something out since the flash unit is pretty big and I like to keep it inside it's case to avoid damaging it.Inside the case, it has those adjustable foam pads with velcro which are setup to fit about 4 lenses, plus your camera body w/ 1 reasonably sized lens.  The two side pockets are roomy and fit plenty of odds and ends.  It has a zipper pocket on the top inside which fits a lot of items.  The front zip section has two small pockets and can accommodate plenty of stuff (this is the section where I keep my wallet and such)The shoulder pad kind of sucks and the plastic clips that hold the strap on the case squeak rather annoyingly if you have a lot in the bag.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  I would suggest that if you need to carry this bag all day, you might want to invest in a better strap and shoulder pad.I don't know how waterproof it is, but it seems reasonably weather resistant.

Some of the third party chargers out there seem really cheap and low quality, so I opted for the JVC brand.The charger has worked splendedly thus far. Charge time is fast, even for the larger battery. The charging unit feels sturdy and well built. The extension cable gives a nice amount of length. I take one star away because a Sony charger I bought nearly five years ago for an older MiniDV is so much more compact, has no cables, and plugs directly into a wall socket which means it takes up less room than this product.

"This stylus is excellent. Here's the good:  I love the smooth handwriting, printing, and drawing. It glides across both my iPad and iPhone with no friction. The resulting images are smooth. This pen more than meets my expectations. I can journal in any of my note taking apps just like I'm writing with pen or pencil on paper. And, while I'm not artist, I feel like one because the pen tip is precise. I used many other styli, they are worthless compared to the Adonit Stylus, and I do not make this statement lightly. I Love how this pen writes, draws, and prints.  You can use it just as a stylus for the iPad instead of your finger, but why when you can do so much more. On the down side, the tip comes off pretty easy and can be very hard to locate if you are not careful. This requires you to have extra pen tips at all times OR, constantly recap and uncap the pen. Also, the cap does not screw on tight at the top, so you have to constantly tighten it so that you don't lose it. I got really long usage out my tip. Some people have complained that the connectivity lessened over a small period of time. I have not experienced lessened connectivity yet.  This is a great investment for fun and/or productivity.

"These are great recreational gaming / movie headphones when paired with the Beyer EDT 250 velour pads: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MF7W2/ I feel the pads are an essential upgrade, and thus review them as a combined package.Usability:I purchased the headphones for non-competitive gaming on my computer.  Their open design means that I can still hear when the doorbell / phone ring, or when my wife is calling me.  If you turn the volume down, you could carry on a conversation with someone in the same room while still being able to hear the game.  People in the same room won't hear the sound from the headphones unless I turn it up to uncomfortably loud volumes.  That said, they're not ideal for a noisy environment, and if someone else is watching something in the same room you'll have to ask them to turn it down - or put on their own pair of headphones!Sound:They sound clear, full, and rich, and give both games and movies a proper cinematic audio feel.  The bass is sufficient to make explosions feel properly realistic, but restrained enough to keep it from feeling overwhelming or tiring.  The positional audio works well to let me figure out where sounds are coming from - better than my 5.1 speaker system. They may not be ideal for primarily competitive use, where hearing footsteps is more important than having the full dynamic range, but are great for non-competative or recreationally competitive gaming.  The sound is so clear, full, and rich, that they put my existing Logitech 5.1 THX Z-5300e speakers to shame (which originally cost 3 times more than these headphones + pads), and I've started using them for watching movies over my speakers.  I feel like it would be hard to significantly improve on the sound of these headphones without going into audiophile grade gear at 4-5 times the price.Comfort:When paired with the Beyer velour pads, they're very comfortable when not wearing glasses, and after a few minutes I'll forget I'm wearing them, and can use them comfortably for a few hours at a time.  When wearing glasses, there's some noticeable pressure on the temples, where the pads sit on the eyeglass arms rather than on your head, which leaves them fairly comfortable.  I can still use them for a few hours at a time, but I need to occasionally take them off for a moment to relieve the pressure.  I think any circumaural headphones will have the same problem.  With the stock pads, the pads get hot and sweaty after 20-60 minutes of use.Yes, the pads add significantly to the cost of the headphones, but they also add significantly to your comfort when wearing them, and raise this up from a 4 star product to a 5 star one.  The stock pleather pads feel cool initially, but get hot and sweaty within an hour of use in a 68 degree room.  The velour pads stay comfortable, cooler, and sweat free, and are able to elevate these headphones to be comparable to much higher priced models.Overall, if you're looking for comfortable open headphones for recreational use with your computer, these are a great choice combined with the Beyer pads.  I use them with this Rubbermaid hook as a headphone stand: http://www.amazon.com/Rubbermaid-5E12-FastTrack-Hose-Hook/dp/B0009J5NUY/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1352480448&sr;=1-1&keywords;=rubbermaid+fasttrack+hose",2,2,0.0006378835,0.002303405,0.99705875
"First off, please note that I am using these for workouts in the gym. I usually am listening to music with these, and my workouts are rarely past 75 minutes.The Good:-In conjunction with Comply TX-500, these puppies block out a lot of sound.  Despite some reviews that I have read, Comply Foam will work with these headphones, you just need to be a bit forceful when initially applying.  I will try to get a video up sometime soon to show.-Sound quality is pretty good, and they are comfortable enough over the course of an hour or two.-I have tested the microphone on a call or two and have not had anyone on the other end complain.  I also was able to hear them without too much interference.-The recharge time is rather quick.The Not-So Good:-I get cable noise when the cord is resting on my neck, mainly as I am moving around a lot and the cable then bounces against my neck, causing the noise pollution.-When I use the clips to ""shorten"" the cable, the earbuds tend to pull lose when I try to turn my head.  I guess I need to find a shortened length that will both allow for movement, but pull the cable off of my neck.-When these are started up or shut down the audible notification of such operation is orders of magnitude louder than what I have the headphone's music sound level at.-Battery life is ~8hrs.  This is not a problem for me per say, but others may find issue with it.Overall, the goods outweigh the no-so goods for me.  At this time, I would say that these are the best sports headphones that I have used in a gym environment.

"I got mine when they first came out from Bose, I had 5.1 already not Bose, the amp had about a thousand buttons I never could not understand how to use that's why I wanted the Bose 123 I watched the demo from Bose where they put maybe fifty people in a room and had a blockbuster movie at the time playing. Never told them it was 123 they were listening to. There were spekers all around the room the same as I had from my amp it was not a Bose. When the movie was over they were asked how was the sound. They said it was the best they ever heard. I got on the phone right then and there. My unit came in about two weeks. One two three and it was ready to go. The old unit about two days with running all the wires in attic and under house and placing all the speakers. I had watches a action movie with my old system just before 123 came so I could compare the sound. The sound was great but my with old unit there was a part in the movie that sound came from the back and went to the front. This didn't happen with the Bose. The dvd part went out within six months and would not play so Bose sent me a new one right away. I was very happy with the unit blue-ray and as you know it would not play blue-ray.

"A few points about the Bose SoundTrue headphones--They are among the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. They are so lightweight I forget I'm wearing them. They create no pressure against the ears or head, no matter how long they're worn. They don't overheat or become sticky or muggy, no matter how long they're worn. The leather on the ears cups is very soft and non-abrasive.-They are made of plastic, which doesn't feel particularly heavy duty (probably why they are so lightweight), but don't feel as if they'll break any second. The ear cups swivel widely, and the plastic is flexible in general.-They feature a long cord, with inline volume control and microphone that work great. They also come equiped with a study carrying case.-The sound quality is excellent for this level of headphones. As I explore different headphones more widely, I am gaining a better appreciation of the more subtle differences between different headphones and different brands. (Although my ability to describe such differences remains minimal.) These headphones generally sound great. As for more subtle differences, the Bose-lover in the family can't get enough of them, saying the sound is ""stronger"", while I prefer mySennheiser Momentum Headphone - Brown, which I would describe as more ""detailed"".In the end, there is no better way to choose headphones than to try them out youself, especially to determine whether the size and fit are right for you.",2,2,0.0005308177,0.0022205908,0.9972486
"I purchased this lens to replace a fifteen year old version which was always superb as to sharpness, resolution, and contrast.  However, I have wanted the VR function since it came out but didn't go with a VR I version because of the vignettting problem with FX (full-frame) cameras.  As I shoot primarily with a D700 FX, I simply used my old non-VR lens and have produced fabulous portraits for many years with it.Based on reviews and then a one-day rental of the VR II version, I bought a new VR II lens and cannot find the words for how great this lens is.  It is literally perfect, assuming you can handle the weight.  I could care less about how much this weighs as much of what I do is tripod based (no VR needed) and when I am off tripod using the VR, the weight is not a problem as I am a big strong man.Bottom line is this--everything you've read about how great this lens is realtive to performance is true.  Period.  If you don't have professional grade glass in this focal range, there is no better choice.I will say this--it is addictive using super optics.  As a result of my hyper satisfaction with this lens, I ponied up (now am entirely broke) for the 24-70 f 2.8 as well.  Same comments regarding  it.  So, I have the 24-70, 70-200 range fully covered at f2.8.  And, since I also have a D90, I get even greater flexibility of focal length when I need it without using a converter and losing lens speed.By the way, for those who wonder about sharpness at wide open aperture--this lens is simply stupendous.

"I have wanted to try power line networking for a long time but I was reluctant to do so because my home automation system sends signals over the power lines in my house, using the X-10 protocol.  I asked several manufacturers if there would be interference with the X-10 signals and no one responded.Add to that a very bad experience with Netgear customer support last year, and I was quite reluctant to put my toe in the water.But my house is long and skinny and wireless networking required three repeaters to ensure consistent coverage so I decided to give the Netgear package a try, based on earlier Amazon reviews.  As others have noted, the setup was quick and easy (Mac computers running OS X; cable modem) and the system has been very reliable and quick.I am not an engineer but my observation after more than a month of use is that I see no difference in the functioning of my home automation system, so I conclude that interference with the X-10 commands is not a problem.UPDATE, Jan 21, 2010:  Still works great.  I actually measured transmission speeds.... your mileage may vary.  I found I was getting about 12 mbps at the cable modem; the worst reception at one of these Powerline units was 6.5mbps; the best was about 8..... so there is a haircut, but this is MUCH better than any wireless set up I've had in my house, which typically delivered 1 - 3 mbps, even with multiple repeater stations.  And it was cheaper.I have literally found that I can sit within 5 feet of a wireless base station and still get better through-put from an ethernet cable running over to my Powerlne box.  I am doing this for my desktop and for when I'm going to sit for awhile in one place with my laptop.However as noted by other reviewers, performance varies widely from house to house, so let me describe my situation:  I have a long/skinny house with lots of outlets.  I get reception at all of the outlets I've tried, but this is probably due to the fact that I have a signal bridge installed in my electrical panel. (LEVITON SIGNAL BRIDGEis not what I have but it's the same idea.)[FYI: most houses have 220v power at the source.  This is delivered over a three-wire circuit.  Your outlets (except for dryer and electric stove) are all 110v, which is achieved by splitting the 220v source into two buses.  A signal bridge insures that a signal can get from one bus to the other.  Without a bridge, Powerline-type systems reliably pass signals back and forth only over one bus, hence the complaints seen in other comments.  Installing a signal bridge is best left to an electrician.  There are DIY plug-in bridges that you can install yourself  in a 220v outlet but I've never tried one, and they cost about $100.]Note that all of this is relevant if you have your own meter and panel (many apartments and nearly all condos do have their own meter and panel), so the problems experienced by others commentators are likely due to the lack of a bridge, not the fact that they live in a  multi-unit building per se.",2,2,0.0016436066,0.006066906,0.9922895

"------------Introduction------------Throughout this review, I'll explain why I appreciate this headphone to the extent I do, and how it competes with more exquisite offerings from the same manufacturer. But I'll also be comparing to a few other models from different manufacturers as well. Not to mention, with me finally getting my hands on an original PX100, I can finally determine for myself whether or not the PX100-II is actually a worthy successor, or inferior as some suggest. Of course, even that is based on one's own opinion.So, I want to mention one thing real quick before I get started about the headphone itself. The HD598, HD600, and HD650 are some of my very favorite headphones. A few months ago, I was lucky enough to have all three on my desk at the same time. Comparisons raged back and forth, but ultimately, I came to choose the HD598 over both the HD600 and HD650, mostly based on value. Although I really liked the slightly fuller and refined sound of the HD600 and HD650, I still chose the HD598 mainly due to it sounding 90%+ exactly the same but for half the price; as well as having a more airy and spacious sound. So out went the HD600 and HD650. But, the HD598 wasn't safe for long. I soon found even it started becoming uncomfortable after a few hours of use, so I decided to try the PX100-II due to how much lighter it was on paper. To my amazement, not only did the PX100-II surpass the 90%+ matched sound quality test with flying colors, but it's signature simply outclassed the HD598 in most cases. Don't ask me the technicalities of that conclusion, but the PX100-II just sounded more balanced and engaging to me. Truer to the ear, at least based on my preference. Simply said, it just sounded better. And that was the end of the HD598, as the PX100-II took permanent residency. As of now, it's been about 2 years, and my opinions haven't changed, even though MANY more headphones have come and gone. In fact, my positive impressions on the PX100-II continue to strengthen with each headphone they KO. Impossible, right?------------------Build & Ergonomics------------------And here we go with the actual PX100-II critique.Starting off with build, I'll have to say that these are actually very durable. The headband is incredibly tough, yet flexible. I can basically stretch it to any extent I want, while not having any disasterous effects; all in the name of experimenting with clamping force which can alter the sound. Wouldn't be afraid to throw it, drop it, contort it, or whatever. But now let's say it really does break; well that's not so bad either, considering it's very inexpensive to replace. Cord wise, it's pretty thin and rubbery, but I'd say I can't expect too much from a portable. I honestly couldn't care less. I just don't want it to have bad memory retention or extreme microphonics, in which it has neither. In a general sense, these definitely have an above-average build, and I have no worries whatsoever. But that shouldn't matter, as I don't even take them anywhere anyway. I use them as my main rig. Yes, I actually use a portable for my desktop listening. These are that good.Okay, okay, so you caught the part where I said, ""even the HD598 started becoming uncomfortable after a few hours of use"". And yes, I really did mean exactly that. At that point, and even more so now, I've decided that full sized were not really an option anymore for long term use. Knowing and loving Sennheiser's stock sound, the PX100-II was my next best bet. Slightly off put by some of the negative reviews stating it was clearly inferior to it's predecessor, I gave it a spin. And just so happens, probably the best decision I've made regarding audio! Comfort is simply top notch. Full sized headphones simply cannot compete, no matter how many pillowed cushions are attached to it. They have a weight restriction, obviously because they are physically bigger than portables, which usually hampers comfort. That said, the PX100-II already has a huge advantage. Feeling very light on the head, I honestly forgot these were there sometimes. Yeah, you hear that a lot. With all the years I've spent on Head-Fi, I'm pretty sure I've seen that mentioned for nearly every headphone. But I'm extremely picky and have NEVER said that about any headband based headphone before. Even though I'm NOT a fan of supra-aural headphones, I find the PX100-II as one of the only exceptions. They are amazingly comfortable. They're my dedicated movie headphone for that very reason... and my dedicated music headphone... and my dedicated gaming headphone (when I can't use my speakers).------Sound------And now let's hit the sound. Let me rephrase, ""get hit by the sound"".I'm baffled two ways. First, I'm not sure why these have such mixed reviews. I honestly cannot understand why. They are an incredible value and sound as good as their bigger brothers, with certain reserves, and better than most other headphones I've tried. And second, I still cannot even comprehend how good these sound especially for their size, price irrelevant. Did you catch that? Price irrelevant. Smooth, lively, balanced, fun, and inoffensive. It's got a dark undertone to it, and has a thick backbone (somewhat typical of Sennheiser's house sound). It's definitely got a nice weight across the spectrum and is fleshed-out, but also maintains an airiness as well. Surprisingly, it has a pretty nice soundstage and presents itself very nicely. No claustrophobic sound here. Bass, midrange, and treble all seem to intertwine pleasantly. Tonality and texture are both great as well. Bottom line, it simply sounds really, really good.But that's not quite enough said about the sound. We both know that...I want to try and shed some light about the complaints I read about these. Many say they have heavily bloated midbass, sound murky or muddy, and have lousy clarity. It's just not so. The bass is actually well proportioned to the rest of the sound, yet some people interpret it in such a different (negative) way. So obviously, in the IEM world, you cannot get good bass without a good seal, and the same goes for closed headphones as well. With the likes of the PX100-II (open headphones), you don't get any seal whatsoever, so bass is naturally going to need a boost in the first place to keep up with the rest of the sound. So yes, these do have a thick lower section, and a graph will most likely reveal that; but it doesn't hamper clarity or balance whatsoever, nor does it sound even a smidgen muddy. Maybe if you push both sides against your ears there will be too much bass, but otherwise (especially if you decrease clamping force) bass will not be a problem. And again, yes the sound has a darker flavor, but that's expected. I'll even admit, it does have a slight concentration in midbass, but it's nothing that restricts listening enjoyment in my opinion, and it definitely doesn't blur the fine details. In fact, without the slightly bumped bass frequencies, I cannot help but think how bass anemic these would turn out. Every so often, I actually find them lacking a bit on the lower end! That said, I think the bass is at a level that would satisfy the widest range of users. Sorta like what they did with the HD650, but the HD650 easily has more bass than these. Occasionally, I find myself boosting the low end just a tad for certain types of music. But again, I'm a Senn fan, I prefer a slightly darker sound.As mentioned before, the PX100-II beat my HD598 fair and square. I hate using that kind of terminology for something that is so preference oriented, and also against another favorite headphone of mine, but I can't deny that I don't like the PX100-II's presentation of music better. And while I slightly preferred the HD600 and HD650 to the HD598, it wasn't like the margin the PX100-II beat the HD598 by. Referring back to the title, I personally think these could use the nickname of ""HD625"", as I believe it bridges the gap between the HD600's and HD650's in a way; two headphones I could never truly decide on which I preferred more. Luckily for me, now I don't have to, as this ""hybrid"" gets the best of both. All the while, is much more comfortable and saves me lots of money. (I do find the HD598, and especially the HD600 and HD650 among the most comfortable headphones I've used).----------Misc Notes----------A quick note on graphs and how similar the PX100-II sounds to its more reference siblings. If you go to headroom and compare the PX100-II to the HD650, you'll be shocked at how closely the frequencies match up until you hit lower treble. Yes, I realize you cannot base sound off something as simple as a graph, but that just goes to show how similarly tuned the PX100-II really are compared to its technical superior. The graph confirmed it, and most importantly, I've confirmed it with side-by-side comparisons, multiple times. Also, if you throw the HD600 and HD598 into the graph as well, you'll notice how all four headphones measure pretty closely. And under real world testing, I can confirm they do indeed all sound very similar. Indeed, Sennheiser doesn't stray too far from their house sound, and in my opinion, that's a very good thing! Anyway, back on track.-----------Comparisons-----------PX100 ~ Ah, so here's the real question. Is the original better than it's successor? Quite simply, no, it's not. The ""only"" thing I like better about the PX100 is the earpieces have more movement opposite the way they fold inward. In other words, the PX100 aligns absolutely perfectly on one's ear, distributing contact and pressure perfectly. The PX100-II doesn't quite have the range of motion, which is a shame. Luckily, the comfort between the two is still extremely close, with the slight advantage to the PX100 due to the range of earpieces and also being a tad lighter. But that also comes at a price. The PX100 feels like a toy in comparison. PX100-II's build is much superior. But leaving that aside and moving to sound reveals something interesting. Without having major clamp on the PX100, they're simply far too bass light. Like I mentioned above, I think portables deserve a bass bump to compensate for their design which minimizes it in the first place. The added bass makes the PX100-II sound more fleshed-out, more balanced, and fuller sounding. I believe I'm hearing a bit more detail with the PX100-II as well, not to mention it being more engaging. Everything else is pretty close; in a good way of course. So if I already owned a PX100, would I upgrade? Easily.PX200-II ~ And of course, comparisons aren't complete without the PX100's closest ancestor, the PX200-II. I've read some good reviews regarding it and decided ""why not?"" But now I ask myself, ""why?"" Real quickly before the sound; I find the pads more comfortable on the PX100-II, but the donut pads on the PX200-II definitely aren't bad. I honestly can't stand the bulky volume control on the PX200-II, and find it quite ridiculous. But it's the sound, oh the sound. I'm afraid I may have to classify it as one of the worst sounding headphones I've ever heard, period. Very reminiscent of an earbud, these sound extremely hollow, distant, and underwhelming. Not to mention, the bass is so incredible recessed that sometimes I tend to miss a good chunk of the lower sound spectrum! Like I've seen other reviewers mention, they only sound half decent when pressed against your ear. But unfortunately, even after I've bent mine to the point that the left and right pads were touching, the sound still remained far too thin. Easily one of the biggest disappointment in my audio journey (other being: Zino, D600, W3, W4), but that's simply because the PX100-II set my expectation quite high.HD25-1 II ~ Recently, I decided to try my luck with the well established, highly rated, HD25-1 II. I was curious to how well these stacked up to the PX100-II. In short, the PX100-II takes it. Easily. Not sure how one could wear the HD25 for longer than half an hour, but the PX100-II is infinitely more comfortable. Personally, I found the HD25's to have an unpleasant treble spike, and I still liked the PX100-II's tonality more, not to mention it had a better, friendlier presentation of the entire spectrum. Definitely more pleasant to listen to, and obviously, to wear. Not to mention, it's about a 1/4th the price, and much more portable. While I did indeed like the HD25-1 II, it didn't have the realness the PX100-II did. I recall having one of the moments where I listened to the PX100-II, followed by the HD25-1 II and immediately asked myself, ""something sounds off, perhaps I have an EQ enabled"". HD25-1 II has great isolation though!HD598 (round 2) ~ I keep coming back to this review to throw in updates, and this is the most recent out of all the others. Unfortunately, the lure of purchasing the HD598 once more was too strong, and I bought one for the 3rd time. Mainly, I wanted to see if I honestly still held the PX100-II to the high remarks I had given it over a year ago. I was determined that surely the PX100-II wouldn't be as good as I once thought, but I was actually wrong. PX100-II came out on top... again. This time around, I found the HD598 much more uncomfortable than I had last remembered it. Perhaps partially due to how much I've gotten used to the impossibly light clamp of my slightly stretched PX100-II. Aside that, the sound is what really caught my interest. The PX100-II did indeed have the more captivating signature. The HD598 sounded pretty darn close though, as far as tonality. The PX100-II was not quite as bright, and more pleasant to listen to, while maintaining (and in some cases, building upon) the HD598's strengths. Literally the only thing the HD598 had going for it was the ever-so-slightly increased spaciousness. Other than that, well, nothing.HD600 (round 2) ~ Still think I'm over exaggerating the title of HD625? Well, I started to think so too for a while, so I bought the HD600 once more. But this time, I paired the HD600 with the Asgard and the HRT Music Streamer II. What did the PX100-II get? My iAudio 9. That's it. Fast forward a bit when the comparisons were complete. The outcome? They sound shockingly similar folks. The most prominent difference is in the treble region, but even in that regard, it's still quite apparent they're from the same blood. But these minor sound differences are discovered when analyzing the frequency. Unfortunately, for the PX100-II, the biggest difference between the two is the ""authority"" or ""size"" in sound. Not talking about soundstage either. While the signatures between these two are strikingly similar, the presentation is where the bigger drivers come in handy in the HD600's favor, giving a more wholesome sound. PX100-II is perhaps more reminiscent of an IEM presentation in comparison, but nowhere near as closed in or direct sounding as an actual IEM. That said, I still really love the PX100-II's sound, and find ""HD625"" as an appropriate moniker, as it combines what I like best about the HD600 and HD650, yet on a slightly smaller scale. It's the perfect budget alternative to the more expensive models, or simply for someone wanting to hear what the ""HD6**"" signature sounds like. But as far as sound signature goes, I liked the PX100-II better at the time, yet appreciate some of the minor improvements the HD600 brought to the table. If I were to pour money into my rig, the HD600 or HD650 would definitely be my weapon of choice.HD700 ~ Okay, so this comparison really took me for surprise. I originally wasn't even going to compare the two as I thought the HD700 would be significantly ""better"" than the PX100-II, but after an supremely disappointing first listen, I quickly changed my mind and compared the two. And? Well, I am absolutely amazed at how bad the HD700 preforms in perspective to the PX100-II. The HD700's midrange sounded like it was underneath a distant blanket, while the PX100-II sounded so much more clear and upfront. The overall balance was definitely in the PX100-II's favor as the HD700 just sounded unnatural to me. Not as creamy as the PX100-II. While the soundstage was quite a bit more open, I came to prefer the more closed-in, direct approach of the PX100-II. Packed a bigger punch and was overall more enjoyable to listen to. In a nutshell, I would never consider listening to a HD700 if I had a PX100-II in my possession.Q701 ~ While the PX100-II and the HD600 were duking it out, poor Quincy was sitting alone in the corner. But of course, no comparison can be left alone, and I salvaged every headphone I had to compare to the PX100-II. Most weren't even worth mentioning, but something struck me when I listened to the Q701. I really couldn't believe how similar the PX100-II sounded to the Q701 when I applied just a bit more treble via EQ. The frequency presentation was nearly spot on between the two, but the Q701 sounded thinner and less engaging, yet a little ""bigger"" in soundstage. The Q701 was on my Asgard at the time, and also used it with my P650, but my impressions didn't sway too much when switching sources. Hmm, this gets me thinking. Perhaps the PX100-II is a HD600 and Q701 mixed? Wow, I really don't know. Guess I could rename this review to the ""QX100"", but I think I'll stick with the Sennheiser reference so I don't confuse the daylights out of people...Q701 (round 2) ~ Fast forward about a year from my last Q701 comparison, and we end up with yet another pair. This time, I'll be pairing the Q701 with the Vali. First, though, I'd like to mention this Q701 is made in China. While I have no idea if the sound has been modified at all, I can personally attest to the terrible change in comfort and the seemingly squeakier build. With that out of the way, focusing only on sound, I'm very disappointed this time around. It simply sounded way too thin for my liking, as if some of the music was lost somewhere. A smidgen too bright for my liking as well. Swapping out to my PX100-II reveals a thick punch of sound that fills the spectrum far better than the Q701. I mean, it just sounds so much more complete. Warmer tone, complimented by that lovely midrange that the airy and dry rendering of the Q701 couldn't match. Similar to the HD700, the Q701 has a very big soundstage, but I couldn't help but notice it didn't really help its cause. In fact, in many instances I thought it did the opposite of improving musical enjoyment. No matter, even if the Chinese Q701 sounded like a dream, I could never get over its inferior comfort to the already mediocre Austrian version.SR225i ~ Kind of a random throw in, but I figured why not? While I really enjoy the SR225i's midrange, I find overall it's a pretty thin sounding headphone with a jagged edge to the sound. Surprisingly, while the bass is light, it has great texture. Midrange, like I mentioned, is quite nice. Vocals are very upfront an clear. But the treble has a bit too much sharpness to it. Quite dry sounding. The richness of the PX100-II is not apparent in the SR225i, nor is the weight of the sound. Detail retrieval is good on both, and while it's a tad more effortless on the Grado, I don't have hard time hearing the same thing with the PX100-II. While I don't mind the 2D presentation of the SR225i, I like the PX100-II's added spaciousness. Overall I'm finding the PX100-II to posses more weight and feel to the sound, while smoothing out the somewhat harsh treble of the SR225i. Comfort, obviously no match.HE-300 ~ Now we're just playing the temperature game. Warm vs warm. But how does the HE-300 do? Well, for one thing, the HE-300 has gobs more bass than the PX100-II. Sometimes that can be good, but for most cases, I beg to differ. PX100-II easily has it beat in midrange, but the HE-300 is absolutely no slouch in that regard, but it can't equal what the PX100-II can do for vocals specifically. In fact, I find the HE-300 one of the only bassier headphones to have a decent midrange. That aside, treble is more rolled off on the HE-300, more so than something like the HD650. The HE-300 is a bit too dark and bassy for my liking and can sound a bit clouded at times. Listening to the SR225i, HE-300, and PX100-II all side by side, I think it's safe to say the PX100-II sorta sounds like crazy mixture of the two, taking strengths from both. Between all three, no doubt I'd take the PX100-II first.HE-400 ~ I will admit, my perceptions on this hobby are changing once again after my experience with the HE-400 and PX100-II. I'm finding the PX100-II ""better"" no question, no second thought. The PX100-II really hits the sweet spot for me, while the HE-400, not so much. Mids are better on the PX100-II (HE-400 sounds a bit scooped out), as is the treble. HE-400 is significantly brighter and is harsh in comparison. Bass can be debated, but I'm finding the HE-400's pretty overrated. It's headphone bass... it's no subwoofer, and nothing incredibly special. I keep on questioning myself over and over, wondering if I'm hearing correctly. But alas, each and every time I switch back and forth, same results. PX100-II every time. Perhaps the HE-400 misses the mark when it comes to matching my sound signature, and I'll account that to the reasoning behind this experience. But that absolutely goes to show you, once you have ""your"" signature nailed (even if it's done in an inexpensive way) upper tiered superiors that don't match that same preferred signature won't stand a chance.SRH1840 ~ Didn't expect this one, did you? Am I out of my mind? Well, after my HD600 and the rest of my major full sized headphones were sold, I decided to try the SRH1840. To make a short story even shorter, the SRH1840 has found a new home and another Head-Fi'er is probably enjoying them more than I did. In ways, I found it a ""slightly more enhanced"" HD600. Throw the feeble PX100-II into the mix, and the SRH1840 went back into it's box quite quick, but not without a few weeks of comparisons first. Again, the tonality and presentation of the PX100-II captured me better than what was offered by the SRH1840. I did appreciate the great balance offered by the SRH1840, extremely reminiscent of the HD600, but a slightly cleaner presentation and not quite as smooth. Perhaps I didn't have the right amp? Maybe. I tried the Headstreamer, E10, E17, P650, and iAudio 9. Nothing serious, but it's what I had. PX100-II got the iAudio 9.Mad Dogs 3.2 ~ Hmm, I don't even know how to start. While I like what Dan has done to the T50RP, I cant say I'd EVER choose to listen to it over the PX100-II. While actually quite balanced sounding, I found it was way, way too warm. Not to mention extremely congested sounding. Almost like one was listening to all their music at 96kbps. The vocal presentation sounded as if the singer was smothered with a mountain of thickly-woven quilts. It sounded very subdued, from top to bottom. And yes, while it did sound relatively balanced it just was too murky to really enjoy. Listening to the PX100-II after was like wiping off your windshield after going through a mud puddle. The vocals were SO much more clear and involving! The entire spectrum really cleaned itself up, and it re-gifted music its alluring quality. The overall balance and tone of the entire sound just received an enormous face lift, and clarity poured through like sunlight through the clouds. A pretty exhilarating experience if you ask me.----------Conclusion----------So, it's been nearly 2 years since I purchased these. New toy syndrome is an obsolete factor. I've tried and tried to dethrone these, with any remaining bias I had *against* the PX100-II. At this point, I've completely stopped buying headphones. I don't *need* or *want* anything more than what I have now. I'm totally and completely satisfied with what the PX100-II has to offer. It sounds dang close to the HD598, HD600, and HD650; while being literally dirt cheap (as far as headphones go). With absolute everything taken into account, I find the PX100-II is without a doubt, the best value in headphones, bar-none. As to this day, it's still one of the best headphone I've encountered out of the hundreds I've owned, hitting somewhere in my top 10. In reality though, realistically it's my #1 favorite, and as of this moment, it's the *only* headphone I'm currently using... and I plan to keep it that way. Sennheiser absolutely nailed it with the PX100-II, and I'm extremely happy I took the chance to buy it despite its somewhat shady reputation especially when referenced to it's predecessor. If mine ever broke or got lost, I'd buy another in a heartbeat, regardless of whether it defaulted back to its MSRP or not. Simply an unbelievable headphone if you ask me. Absolutely unbelievable.",2,2,0.013363909,0.03529854,0.9513375

"I recently bought an HD Radio for my car and I wanted one for Home to connect to my existing stereo, to get the set of HD channels especially for the HD-2 which they broadcast music with few, if any, commercials.After looking at a lot of HD radios, I purchased this one mainly based on the price and small size.  Overall it works well and I like having a remote.Pros:- small size, fits easily almost anywhere and runs off 120VAC.- good tuner performance.- nice remote control and display.- pretty good sound.Cons:- remote control does not have mute or volume control.- No way to disable the HD and revert to standard FM signal- no way to shut off the display/backlight completely when radio is off.- no 1/8"" stereo output jackIt takes about 5 seconds to complete locking on to the to an HD signal.  This is not noticable for the main HD-1 station, since the radio will play using the traditional analog signal, but if you directly select a preset for an HD-2 station, without being tuned to the HD-1 signal for that station already, the radio will mute for about 5 seconds while it locks.  This is somewhat annoying when scanning thru presets.  But I guess this is better than my other HD radio which will simply skip the HD-2 signal if you are not already locked to its HD-1.

My setup included several hard-wired Ethernet ports and a half dozen or so Wi-Fi connected devices including iPads, iPhones, Droid phones, a wireless printer, and a TiVo network connection. All were securely added to the network smoothly and easily with a conveniently located Wi-Fi Protected Setup button that initiates a 2-minute window in which any WPS-enabled device can enter the wireless network.Performance:  Not even looking at the new high speed 802.11ac capabilities, the basic 802.11n functions better than any of several home routers I have owned both in higher power around the house and greater stability of the network (hasn&#8217;t gone down since original installation). I give this router a big plus on this count and am anxious to try out one of the 802.11ac NIC Wi-Fi once I get one. Everyone on the network is happy with performance of this new router, and everyone agrees&#8212;whether using an older iPad that has 802.11g Wi-Fi or the latest KFHD with 802.11n Wi-Fi&#8212;speed is noticeably faster and signal strength is strong and stable, even in the back yard, which has a house between the signal source and the device receiving it.Other Points of View:  CNET gave this router high marks in a June 2012 review but downed it for being bulky, not cool looking, and power hungry. The unit I have runs cool, is attractive, has a small footprint, and hasn&#8217;t blown any breakers! I give it my best rating.",2,2,0.0010369254,0.0031600518,0.99580306

"Bought one pair and liked them so much I bought a second pair. I had to buy and install BlueSoleil software to use the headphones. They then paired with my laptop and my desktop with a bluetooth dongle with no issues. I like how you can change between the five different sound modes. They fit comfortably on my head with no squeezing pressure as some others one I tried. The range is fairly decent letting me go through out the house and halfway down the driveway. Stick to listening to just music when using these as there is a terrible lag when you try to watch a movie. This might be due to the BlueSoleil software. My only concern may be how will the plastic parts hold up. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase.",2,2,0.00066505326,0.012794475,0.9865405

"I've had these driving my spare Tannoys for a few days playing music and movie/games out of it.  It is nice and beefy and has plenty of power.But I mainly bought these initially as a headphone amp and there are several issues.  From what I can tell, the speaker stays on when you plug the headphones in.  Huh?  This is kind of a /fail.  I have to disconnect the speaker cables if I want to only hear out of the headphones.  There should be a auto switch to shut off the speakers if you have headphones connected.Headphone amp is okay...  It strains to drive my more higher end headphones. I own several including a Denon AH-5000 and AKG 702s as well as a few others.  But driving my AKG 240's and a fairly high end ""gaming"" headphones by Razor, it was fine.If you're not looking to drive expensive, power hungry headphones, these sound natural and fine for the price I paid.  It really shines more as a stereo amp which it excels!",2,1,0.18785919,0.77506846,0.03707234
"I currently do not own a home security system. I had considered a dvr based one that came with say 4 cameras. When given the option of this unit I was intrigued. It seemed to check off several boxes for me with regard to an all in one unit.First off it installs easily. From the software you install on your PC to the actual placement of the cameras it is all very straight forward.Second it includes a way for me to watch the feeds from my phone (big plus).Third it alerts me via the phone whenever someone may be stepping onto my property.Very cool.Pros:>> easy to set up both software wise and physical location wise.>> can add as many cameras that you like (up to a predefined limit)>> High cool factor that is useful too.Cons:&lt;&lt; Kind of wish it was wireless for some cameras instead you have to run cables to the camera locations.&lt;&lt; cost is a tad close to the low end DVR models so, whereas you could hide the dvr in a closet or attic, you probably wont hide your pc that way. Which means if someone broke into your house they would essentially steal the evidence when they take your PC. You could get a stand alone unit, but that adds to the cost even more. Not a huge issue just one to think about.Overall, very happy with the quality. Its not HD but its probably good enough to use in court.Thank you for reading my review.",2,2,0.002491864,0.015487305,0.9820209

"Primarily I use a digital camera for pet photography (I've won several contests with the photos I take), landscapes, flowers, and video. Although this camera has its GOOD points, it was LOUSY on the Pet Scene. Certain features are disabled on Pet Scene that bother dog and cats (which sometimes is a good idea) such as the focus assist light and beeps/shutter sounds, but the default setting was continuous, not single, and I couldn't choose flash if I wanted. It wouldn't take an image unless it recognized a cat/dog face from a front view. Images were grainy and too dark even in a room with daylight streaming in. Very disappointing on the Pet Scene Setting, but otherwise such as landscapes, flowers, that was decent. Yes, I know I can use manual controls to try for a better pet shot, but cats and dogs will run off before you have all the settings just right.Good points of the P310:> Quality build - except for the battery door seems a little flimsy, but it seems they all are.> Quick start-up if you don't use the Coolpix logo welcome screen.> Love the manual control knob on top - and between that one and the back knob, you can control f-stop and shutter easily.> Good weight to it, buttons and knobs work well with chubby fingers.> Good macro - since I love photographing flowers, this passed my test.> I liked the NX software that came with this camera, intuitive, feature rich.Bad points of the P310:> Battery charging is done inside the camera, and I hate those rubbery covers that usually end up breaking off - of course, this can be remedied by buying a separate charger. And it seems 80% of the cameras I've purchased recently are going to this battery charging method to save money, of course.> Video quality was not up to par with my other (cheaper) cameras; however, zoom motor was fairly quiet.Bottom Line: If you want a camera for photographing things other than pets, this camera is a good choice. It may have too many features to learn if you're new to digital cameras and want a basic point and shoot, unless you keep it on AUTO.No camera is perfect, I like others better mainly because Sony happens to know the correct way to program the processor for the Pet Scene.",2,0,0.59501433,0.39190963,0.013076004

"It's the LCD screen that sets this clock radio apart from all others. An LCD screen gives unlimited control of the display and options just like a preference panel on a computer application. Sony takes great advantage of this by providing big easy to read numbers, clear displays of alarm settings when on, intuitive and extensive controls of its functions, and even display of music track data when playing an iPod. The photo and video display works well as long as you sit close. Sound is also OK but it is a clock first and music player second. I was also able to get an Internet streaming radio application to play through the clock.The other reviews pointed out some quirks such as not being able to delete the factory images (nature scenes I can live with, but someone else's kid??), the date format is locked to YYYY/MM/DD which is annoying to some US users. There is no indication if this will be able to fixed with a firmware update someday.The hardware buttons are well marked and intuitive. It looks like many of faults of the ICF-C7iP were addressed, including better controls and the ability to darken the screen to nearly black (a touch of the far left button on the base will slightly lighten the display for a few seconds, touch the snooze bar for full brightness settings).One missing feature is the ability to have something other than a photo as a background behind the numbers. The mountains are pretty but make reading the clock harder. I solved that problem by making 800x480 jpeg images of several solid colors and putting them onto a small SD card. I found a dark blue background worked best. Another suggestion would be the option of displaying an analog face with a sweep second hand. There is lots of screen space not being used when just the clock is displayed.I have been pretty happy with this. It adds features I have always wanted in a clock radio, it charges and plays my iPhone 3G without interference issues, and the settings for the alarm are numerous, intuitive, and clearly marked when they are on.EDIT: For those reporting crashes be sure to update the firmware following the directions from the Sony website.EDIT (6-24-2010): iPhone 4 WILL work. You will need to remove the base adapter for the 3G phones and iPod Touch. Slip a knife into the slot near the rear top of the adapter and gently pry up. The phone actually fits pretty well without the adapter in place, and is nice and snug.

"I use a Zagg screen protector for my Kindle Fire and I have just been annoyed with how I can't read under light or see my face while I'm reading. I did a quick search for a good glare reducing screen protector and was brought to GreatSheild's Ultra Anti-Glare screen protector. Instead of taking off my Zagg screen protector since I love the protection aspect of it, I just applied it directly over top. Be warned: This screen protector easily leaves bubbles, but I just used a debit card with hard pressure to smooth them out.I was instantly surprised. I usually can't read my Kindle Fire on the train during the 5pm time because of the sun, but I could easily see all of the words and no longer stared at my own face. People who complain it's ""cloudy"" forge the point of the screen protector and should not have bought it in the first place. I had a protector just like this for my Kindle Keyboard and loved it. And for the price, you get 2 plus a cleaning cloth! You're going to need your own credit card to push air bubbles out, but who doesn't have that?Overall, this is an AWESOME protector and cuts ALL of the glare out of my Kindle Fire. I am extremely happy with my purchase.",2,2,0.0056125494,0.0074331937,0.9869543
This is the best hd player hands down that is presently on the market. Right now it does seem as if blu-ray has a strong advantage in the format war due to warner brothers recent decision but don't let that stop you from buying this player (if you can find one). Even if hd dvd dies you will still have the best upconverting dvd player on the market and you will still be able to enjoy a library of over 400 hd dvd movies. Also consider the fact that Toshiba won't stop making dvd players which means there will be options to get it serviced in the future should it break down on you.

"I have had 4 of these fans in an HTPC for over a year now, and couldn't be happier with their performance.  With my previous setup with a less powerful CPU, I left the thermostats on and couldn't even tell when the PC powered on.  Mind you that's with FOUR of these.  When I upgraded to a beefier (read: hotter) CPU and the case wasn't staying cool enough, I removed the thermostats and while there is a touch more noise, it is STILL quiet.  My Xbox 360 Slim sitting next to it is louder.  A set of 4 of these was perfect for my small-form-factor case (Silverstone SG02).

"I have been using a Nikon Coolpix 950 (2MP) camera for several years and decided to buy the 2100 as a gift for my wife around 12/2003 from Amazon. I had been satisfied with the quality of photographs for the 950 and am now also satisfied with the 2100. For about 1/6th of the price and less than 1/2 of the size, the quality of the 2100 is nearly identical. As an all-around point-and-shoot for a very good price, the 2100 is a winner. However, my suggestion is to use only disposable or rechargeable Lithium-based batteries and not NiMH.I hesitated writing a review until I could figure out a problem with rechargeable batteries. The disposable CR-V3 lithium battery is excellent and can easily last a few months and a few hundred pictures. Flash recharge time is acceptable (although when you have infants or toddlers who don't sit still it might not be!). But when I used high-capacity (2000 mAh) 1.2V rechargeable NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) batteries, the flash recharge time was poor and it would take many seconds to be able to take the next picture. A low-battery indicator would be displayed too soon even if the batteries had enough of a charge, suggesting that the lower voltage (2.4 V for NiMH versus 3.0 V for the disposable) made it difficult for the camera to sense the true strength of the charge that was left. Even worse, the short shelf life of even fully charged NiMH batteries rendered them almost empty, at least as the 2100 saw them, after two or three weeks of no use so we would have to keep swapping in fully charged batteries. The 2100 did get a firmware upgrade that mentions addressing problems with NiMH batteries, but our camera was shipped with the latest. So after numerous attempts at using various brands of rechargeable NiMH batteries, which is the kind that is popular for digital cameras, I was discouraged.Then I found the ""RCR-V3"" battery on the web, a replacement for the CR-V3 disposable. Thomas Distributing sells a couple brands that will cost upwards to $40 including the charger and shipping. But now I can say it was worth it. With the RCR-V3, the low-battery indicator does not show up prematurely, the flash recharge time is as short as the disposable CR-V3, and the shelf life of the rechargeable is excellent for more than a month. We have the NEXcell brand, but I think any of the brands would work well. Now I highly recommend this camera, as long as it is using lithium based batteries.",2,2,0.039884023,0.10491033,0.8552056

"I've been using an Espon Powerlite 1080p for the last 2 years until it died 2 weeks ago.  I had pretty high standards and am very impressed so far with this projector.  It is literally half the size of the Epson and almost twice as bright!  Even in the Smart Eco mode that saves 70% on the lamp life, it is surprisingly bright.  Contrary to what others have said, I am happy with the screen adjustments (done via a small screw).  The biggest downfall of the Epson was that it would constantly lose it's screen adjustment settings, this projector does not do that.  The other issue people have complained about is getting the 3D to work properly.  Just to clarify, it will not play Side by Side 3D via 1080p 60hZ.  You have to adjust your source to 1080p 24hZ in order to play Side by Side 3D.  I had trouble figuring this out at first because my media player resolution could not be changed.  It turned out that I just had to change the output resolution on my Onkyo receiver.  It works via 1080p 24Hz or Direct options.  My kids love the 3D and run around screaming trying to grab the images coming out of the screen.  You can't go wrong with this projector for the price.  It is easily as comparable to another projector 2 or 3 times the cost.  Another great feature is the build in speaker.  It is much louder than I thought.  I can't wait to use this to watch movies outside this summer without having to worry about lugging around speakers.",2,2,0.002461126,0.007409842,0.99012905
"I have really enjoyed using and working with the tools provided with the Dell Duo.  For my needs this is a 5 star machine; however, it is slow when compared to a full sized and powerful desktop and laptop.  The Duo has become my riding buddy and is with me most of the times I have to visit one doc or another.  Instead of lugging the 18.4"" laptop into a docs office I take the Duo and have all I need.  Many of the offices have WiFi especially at the hospitals and that makes its value to me even better.The other day I visited one of the docs and he was touting his new iPad as if it were some really super tablet and it was.  His is such an advance in the world of medicine and quite handy for him and his needs.  The Duo is not an iPad nor is it suggested as a comparative device.  Each is separate in terms of abilities.  In the early 80s I bought a Radio Shack Model 100.  It is similar in size to the Duo and that's the end of the comparison.  To think that I carried a 64Kb (that's the optional additional memory)computer that then was state of the art compared to a 320Gb monster that uses some of the best technology available.While I sincerely like this device I do have a slight fault with Dell's not providing a flash drive for downloading use.  Luckily, I have one and it worked fine but its inclusion would have added value to an already great value.  I have not needed a SIM card yet; however, inclusion of one would not have been so awful since their prices are far better than retail.  While it would have been nice to have included the JBL Audio Station (the optional external sound amplifier and apps device) I can understand their not wanting to increase the retail by about $100.Thank goodness the AC adapter was included.  The battery life has not lasted 3 hours yet and most of the time I get about 2 hours of use.  That's not a very big deal unless there are some significant delays but 2 hours appear to be too short.  I think I prefer the lighter weight instead of the heavier weight associated with extended battery life.  The RS 100 takes 8 AA batteries and it's a heavy machine.  I like the battery life indicator and that is a good tool for external usage.When the box arrived I fully expected an enjoyable set-up experience based on previous Dell products and I was not disappointed except for one suggestion I would make to Dell.  They could retail a basic unit such as this one is and a full-kit unit that would include the JBL, flash drive, SIM card, mini-mouse and a case that would hold the computer and the accessories.  Set-up was a breeze.  From step one through the entire process I ran into absolutely no problems and all processing took place as it should have.  It is so wonderful to receive an instruction booklet that actually instructs the user.  I look back to the RS 100 and recall the instruction booklet was bigger and more complicated than the entire Duo and the Duo puts the RS 100 to shame.  But then again, it had better.The screen size is small; however, that is compensated for by the use of better resolution that other similar devices.  The screen reminds me of a high definition TV picture compared to a standard definition one.  The HD quality makes reading the screen so much easier.  While it has a magnifier included in the software I do not use it but it is a nice addition.I highly recommend this machine and feel it would be a waste of time to go into all the details available.  While I suggested it is slow I also realize that the speed is not critical.  Most of the time we are not capable of interfacing with the computer at the same speed.  Best of all is the dual aspects of the machine.  Gone are the days of having to open the clam shell and here are the days of touch screens that do not have to be opened to handle routine matters.  Then couple the gestures and other touch screen features and this machine acts like one of the big boys.Should anyone want detailed information please do not hesitate to contact me about this.",2,2,0.001021952,0.009858055,0.98912
"For about 3 weeks, I had been reading the forums about the ASUS UL30A & UL20A & the wireless network problems that many people complained about.It seemed so wide spread that I was afraid to buy one & just kept putting it off & continued using my ASUS EEE PC1005HA P.

"There are detailed reviews, so I'll focus on my personal experiences:In general, a GPS unit is NOT NECESSARY for safe driving.

"This is a nice compact hub for use with USB2 interfaces. It does need to plug into a wall outlet, but it has its own surge protection.With the speed at which new electronics come on the market, I wonder why one would choose a hub with USB2 ports, when you can already buy hubs with USB3 ports. After all, the USB3 hubs do support all lower USB interfaces. But using a USB2 port for a USB3 interface will not make the USB2 hub go any faster.You know that saying: &#34;You are only as strong as your weakest link&#34;? Well, the same applies here. If your device has USB3 capability, this hub will hold it back to USB2 speeds. The hub will only run at the lowest USB in your chain.This hub does have a surge protector and that is a very nice feature. I guess that if you are not planning to buy any new mobile devices in the near future, this USB2 hub will work fine for you at a very reasonable price.The cords are too short for me to use this on my desk: The cord from the wall outlet to the hub is only about 50&#34; long. The cord from the hub to the computer is a tad over 3 feet. So, visualize where you want to put this hub, and take some measurements, before hitting the gimme' button.See the LED bar on top of the hub that runs through the center?

"My first Leica that is affordable. I was going back and forth between this and the Panasonic LX5 as they are essentially the same camera as I've read. I wanted something for travel and as a backup to my Canon dSLR. This is smaller than I expected which is actually great because I can fit it in my pocket!As for price, if you think about it, the copy of Adobe Lightroom and the 3 year warranty basically means it costs about the ""same"" as the LX5 if not getting a better deal IMO.  Yeah, I like the red dot too...and the build is really solid for this camera..and a beautiful one at that. The menu is pretty intuitive. The manual isn't all that informative.Picture quality looks great, I like the different formats..I can take square pics or wide angle..The special effects aren't as robust as the Olympus Pen, but I use graphic editing programs anyway....gets a little noisy above 1600  but again, I have noise reduction software..but for its size and convenience and the fast 2.0  lens, available light photography is great. I use this mainly as my street photography/photojournalism cam.I would've given it 5 stars if it had a viewfinder...I really wish these companies producing these compact cameras, 4/3 cameras and the like would have a built in viewfinder..it only makes sense.

"I'm a real fan of the MSI boards, I have never gotten a clunker or had any issues. This board is no different. If you're in a tight case, you might think about plugging the front case connectors before mounting the board as they are jammed in the very corner (as is the onboard USB 3) - also the schematic on the board (where the HDD, LED and such go) is a couple of slots over from the actual pins. One of the mounting screw holes is right next to a capacitor, which makes it a bit of a hassle to screw in. There's no clear documentation (at least in the package I got) of which slots the DIMM's go into if you only use two of the four slots. But these are all tiny quibbles for a solid board. The OC Genie II took the X4 965 Deneb in this box from 3.4 to 4.17 without any manipulation.  The board runs really cool and the layout feels very spacious when adding in cards.

"I bought these, turned them on and was...disappointed with the NoiseGard functionality. Music sounded good, but I couldn't tell that these headphones did much of anything. Then, I read the manual and realized you had to push and hold the NoiseGard button for a few seconds to activate that functionality. Cue angelic chorus chord progression and sudden mystical ray of light shining from above! They are awesome!I bought these to drown out the blabbing and gossiping of my coworkers and they work well for this purpose. Incidentally, they also drown out blabbing and nagging from family; an unexpected bonus! They do work best for steady noises like jet engines, nagging, babbling brooks, the clinking of gold ducats in my pocket as I walk down the street, etc. Obviously if your litmus test of noise-cancellation is to expect absolute silence while your roommate blasts Call of Duty at the highest possible volume, you're going to be disappointed by any brand of headphones.Reading the reviews, I expected to be disappointed by the bass. In the interests of full disclosure, I listen primarily to techno so it's not like I care much about the world's most accurate reproduction of the mellowest flute or anything. These sound good to me; I suspect some reviewers must be used to audio reproduction where bass is overly-enhanced. The SRS function is not really to my liking, I figure it's just kind of a value-added feature they threw in.I also want to point out that the rechargeable battery is replaceable and removable. You can actually charge the battery outside of the headphones too. Unlike other headphones where the battery is built-in and the headphones eventually don't hold a charge, these are meant to last for years.",2,2,0.0017810173,0.0074433885,0.99077564

"We bought this tv about 14 days ago. Currently we have another model of Sony HD tv, and even both are HD, I have to say, the motionflow makes a difference. However, there are two flaws on this tv. First, by itself it is not as loud as I would have imagined. Since everyone uses with it home theater it is just a minor detail. Second, when one watches movies on Netflix through the Sony/Netflix TV's software and not through PS3 or WII, it does not show option for closed captions/subtitles, even the movie comes with it on those other devices.",2,1,0.12366803,0.7450052,0.13132678
"I love this little radio. Its very light and I can wear it around my neck collar and listen to it with out the headphones or without holding in my hand. I live in an area with limited reception and work in a building that makes it even worse. This radio is still able to pull in reception and make the day easier to get thru (crappy job). People often confuse it for a cell phone and hardly ever think its a radio. Once you get used to the buttons and how Sangean has programmed them, its pretty easy to use. I get outstanding battery life as well. Sometimes I think today is the day the batteries will wear out, then the thing keeps playing for another week before I actually have to change them. Its not perfect, but for the weight, size and performance I dont think theres another radio out there to choose over this one. I use it more for AM talk radio than music and FM sounds much better thru headphones than the little speaker. So, in the end, its a good small radio, but it depends what your needs are when considering buying this.Also, I do not like the earbuds( hate all earbuds) that it comes with and I use Sony with it now.",2,2,0.0004161676,0.0040495456,0.9955343
"Pros:1) Great sound (&gt;98dB signal-to-noise ratio beats Ipod's ""unspecified"" ratio) and good power output allow the Zen Xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers.  With my Sennheiser 497 headphones, the volume is loud enough at 12 (max is 20).  The player works well with my Sony SRS-A202 powered speakers.2) The player user interface (UI) is intuitive to use, and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection.3) The Nomad Explorer (WinXP style interface) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the Nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player.  The Nomad Explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like Notmad.4) USB 2.0 means fast data transfers (1 song/sec!).5) The cheap, user-replaceable battery ($50 from Creative) is a great advantage over the Ipod's battery which costs $100 to replace.6) Excellent battery life - 14 hours beats Ipod's.7) Chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate.  I use it primarily in the provided protective case although I have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk (by accident) as well as have played it outdoors in -30 Fahrenheit weather (by design) and it has continued to work fine.8) Creative Mediasource, although not as sleek looking as Windows Mediaplayer, is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good CDDB service (Gracenotes).a. The CDDB downloads information for the CD that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album, artist, song title, etc.  I don't always care for Gracenotes' genre listings but it allows easy editing of ID3 tags.b. Fast Mediasource CD ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a CD on my Pentium 4 PC (2.4GHz with 1Gb RAM) with 52X drive.c. I do love Audiosync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer.9) Wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play Selected Music at a specified time.  I have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning.10) Multiple play modes - tracks in order of album, shuffle, etc., is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the Zen Xtra is not deficient in this matter.11) Minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player12) Big storage - my entire CD collection in one small device (5717 songs, 491 albums and counting)!Cons:1) Player is not plug and play - need to install Nomad Explorer first and Mediasource to transfer files and I had to be patient as I was used to WinXP detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it.2) Music organization is based on ID3 (by genre, artist, album, etc.) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect ID3 information.  This was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own CDs and I updated the ID3 tags on my downloaded music.3) Folders cannot be created for the audio files.  This is unnecessary with ID3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the Zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on ID3 tags.  The workaround is to update ID3 tags on your files (through Mediasource) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files.4) No FM or voice recording - these would have been nice extras.5) Lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of Creative's marketing.  Both Creative and third-party powered speakers work great, as do third-party wireless transmitters.  A dock is unnecessary as the charger and USB cable do the necessary.6) The Case occludes the display screen when it is closed.  I would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case.7) Some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch.Experience:Once I got home with it I had to first install Creative Mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player.  This required patience as I was used to WinXP detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it (which I could do with my flash player).  I did already have Mediasource installed due to owning the Creative Audigy 2 soundcard but I did need to re-install it from the supplied CD as the older version did not have the connector to the Zen.  Also, I downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates.Recommendations:1) Buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive.2) Buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one.3) Use files with ID3 tags - not a problem if your CDs were ripped within the last year.4) A set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player's usability (the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio, home receiver, etc.)5) Handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped.Resources: [...] [...]Pros summary:Great sound; good interface; replaceable, powerful battery; good software; wake-up, sleep timers; multiple play modesCons summary:Not plug &amp; play; relies on ID3; no FM or recordingBottom-line: Can't beat carrying 500-CD collection with me wherever I go.  My favorite is to play ""any track""- am rediscovering my music!  Also love waking up to music with attached speakers.",2,2,0.0037186304,0.040024508,0.9562569

"I will try not to repeat what I have read in other reviews. One thing I cant tell you is that my canon 18-135 mounted on my 60D does search for focus a bit before taking the picture. Another aspect that is important to describe to would be buyers is that the depth of field is a challenge. If you are taking a picture of the insect and you want its whole body to be in focus you will have to place you lens sideways to the insect or some parts of the body will not be that well defined in the picture. On the same token, this is going to be a good leans to use in any situation where the object has what you want to show at a similar distance to the front of your lens but if it is very curvacious, it will be a challenge to take the picture as you want it to be. This may sound very obvious for the experienced photographer but it is not so intuitive (how this lenses impact you macro shots)to the ones that are not doing this for some time. In any case, I recommend these. They are pretty good and deliver the result with no visible distortion. You are also going to find that using the +10 is very hard. Much easier to use the others but, it is a lot of fun and you will have amazing results with all of them",2,2,0.005803495,0.119721845,0.87447464
"Had to update this review as I have also experienced the broken plastic piece that holds the headband, so you can't wear it on your head without repairing it.  I was able to do so with a couple of wire ties, but it looks a bit sad.  Poor quality plastic was used and it fractures with regular uses.  now that I've repaired it, it will probably last.  Still very happy with the quality of the sound both send and receive.Plugs into the wall jack so it is a stand alone device, but you need to have another phone in the house to make outgoing calls.  I use my other phones to make the call, then join the call with this headset and hang up the other phone.  This may link to DECT 6 remote phones, but I didn't try that.  Didn't seem to be a need to do that and tie up another station on my phone system.  The incoming volume is widely adjustable.  The outgoing voice is clearly heard on the other end.  Only downside is that it is hard to tell when you have pressed the mute button.  I sometimes have to walk back to the base station to see the indicator since people talking loud can cover the small beep that happens when you put the device on mute.",2,2,0.0012293328,0.012754198,0.98601645

The materials and construction are good-the internal cover in touch with the screen is lined with felt and is non-scratch. It took a bit to snap the iPad in but once it was in it was very secure.What I did not like:The elastic back strap works only if you slip your entire hand through to near your wrist. However, this makes for uncomfortable long term reading as the wrist is almost bent unnaturally with the iPad screen hitting your lower arm. However it works well for composing an e-mail on the go. My opinion is it needs to be relocated centrally so you don't have to slip the hold hand through to get a good grip.

"I had given up on dedicated cameras once the iPhone went HD for video.  After all, I always have it with me and downloading videos and stills are as easy as I could hope for.  The only thing I had missed was optical zoom.  Along comes the Canon Vixia.  First, it is small and light enough to fit easily in my pocket.  While it isn't always with me like a phone, it is really easy to take along with me when I plan on needing a camera.  The HD recording quality (at the highest setting) is outstanding.  A combination of excellent lenses, top quality sensor, and full 1080p HD make for professional quality recordings.  The SD slot allows for more recording time. The built in 8GB of memory isn't enough to record more than a quick sample of HD, but with a 64 GB SD card inserted, I can record about four hours of HD.  The image stabilizer does an excellent and seamless job of keeping your videos from looking like the Blair Witch Project.  In fact, motion is where this camera really stands out.  When recording MP4 at the highest setting, I am able to capture lacrosse in full speed without any blur.Now for my favorite feature:  Video downloads finally done right!  With many other cameras (and Canon has been a major culprit in this) the videos are stored in an unusable file format.  You have to download proprietary software, or with Canon, Pixela software, just to off-load your videos to view and share them.  This Canon Vixia saves your videos in plain old MP4 format.  That means you can simply pull out the SD card, put it in the SD slot in your computer, and drag and drop the videos right to your hard drive!  Finally, a camera with file transfer as simple as an iPhone!  Now, you can also use  AVCHD format, which will save you some file size giving you longer recording time, but then you have to use Pixela to off-load the video.  For me, the relatively small filesize difference isn't worth it to lose the easy downloading.You can take still shots with the camera, but that isn't it's strong suit.  You can take 3.28 MP photos, which is basically a still shot from a HD video.  Good in a pinch, but not your go-to still shot camera.Now for the only less than perfect aspects.  First, the lens cover is manually operated.  On the one hand, it uses less battery that way, and it means fewer things to break, but on the other hand, you do have to remember to open and close the lens cover.  Also, the switch for the lens cover isn't well placed.  You can't quite move it with your right pinkie, so you have to bring your other hand over to open the lens cover.  The other issue is the WiFi connectivity.  I haven't seen any practical use for it.  I connected it to my router at home, but then nothing.  It doesn't show on my my network map.  I cannot transfer images or video from it wirelessly.  Basically, you connect it to your WiFi in order to use it as a security camera.  Cool feature, but really not all that necessary.  The other reason for WiFi is to connect directly to your iPhone.  Again, there are a couple of apps that allow you to work the camera like a remote control, and that is cool, but in order to use them, you have to disconnect from your WiFi access point and re-connect to the camera.  In the field, this might be useful, but at home it is too much hassle to be worth it.Overall, this is an outstanding video camera, likely the best I've ever used.  It comes with a decent still shot capability, and some wireless features that are icing on the cake.  Above all, the video transfer is easy and sensible, a rarity in camcorders today!",2,2,0.0003930124,0.0017902907,0.9978167

"I have used this for about two years now to play music from iPhones and iPads and am still very pleased with it.  It has a small form factor, great looks, decent battery life, puts out good sound and gets plenty loud enough for listening throughout 1-2 rooms of the house or for small gatherings.  It sounds best in ""Live Audio"" mode which I believe is supposed to be 3D sound but it limits the max volume greatly.  It gets quite a bit louder in ""normal"" mode but the sound becomes a bit muddier and isn't as crisp.  My only issue with the Jambox is that with bassier music, it tends to ""dance"" around on smooth, flat surfaces and can fall if placed on a table or countertop.  I have remedied this by placing on a towel or other vibration-absorbing item and then it won't move from its resting place.  Overall this was a great investment and Jawbone seems to provide outstanding customer support and plenty of firmware updates.BTW- If you need something that can be cranked to 11, you might want to look at the Big Jambox.",2,2,0.00047994344,0.0049403203,0.9945798
"Used this product on a cruise late August 2010 to secure MacBook Pro (mid 2010) to a desk in our cabin. Picture is included above in ""customer images.""

Once attached and locked, the head of the locking unit rotates a full 360 degrees to enable SuperDrive use.

Cable cutters are unlikely to be allowed through embarkation security, but the correct ""industrial strength"" tool could probably cut the cable.

"This case is nice and sleek, had good access to ports and is quiet on the low or medium setting, but a bit loud on high.  It would be nice to adjust the fan speed from the exterior (it is on about an 8in cable inside the case and would take some work to get it on the outside).  I haven't had any the static problems that others reported (had it since beginning of Feb '10).  The case is a nice black piano finish everywhere except the front, which is black plastic.  The front panel is nice and opens wide (I have a 2 yr old, and a 9 month old who is starting to walk and it keeps them out of the optical drives/card reader I have installed).  I didn't have any cuts from the metal from the initial install or when adding all the extra hard drives and re-routing cables, but there are a few sharp edges, so be mindful. Also, one of the rubber feel fell off when I was sliding it back into my desk, but it caught on an edge (it went right back on and have had no problems since, but it's only glued on not screwed).The internals are nice too.  The front panel cables are long enough to reach near the back if your motherboard has connections toward the rear.  The motherboard installed easily, and the power supply has plenty of power connectors (see Antec's web site for specifics).  I don't think it will work with dual video cards though. I have 2 optical drives, card reader and 3 hd (going to ad a 4th soon) and the power supply still has extras if I need it.  The hard drives have rubber gromets that isolate them.  There are a few areas that allow you to tuck away the extra cables to keep the case clean.  There's not a cable management system, but it was easy to zip tie where I wanted to to keep things clean and organized.Air:I initially used only the single 120mm fan on medium and everything kept cool, so I put it on low and found that everything was still very cool.  When moving large files though, my hard drives got a little warm, so I added a second Antec Tri-cool 120mm fan in the front to help.  It actually mounts in the middle of the case (if looking at the side-shot photo) just to the left of the hard drives.  This is ok, but I had to move a few wires around since this is right where all my SATA and front panel hookups are on my motherboard.  Not a big deal though, and my hard drives are running a little cooler.  The power supply is also amazingly quiet and, along with my hard drives during larger transfers, is the only thing that gets even SLIGHTLY warm with my setup.Overall, still quiet running the rear fan on med or low and my front (middle) fan on low.  The front fan isn't even necessary though, just thought I'd add one since they're under $15.  Can't even tell the cpu fan is running, and can barely hear my caviar black hard drive and 2 older western digital ide drives.My setup:- This case- AMD Athlon II x2 240 w/stock fan & radiator- Gigabyte GA-MA785GMT-UD2H Micro ATX Motherboard- Corsair CMX4GX3M2A1600C9 XMS3 4 GB PC3-12800 Core i5 Memory Kit (yes, it works on an AMD system too)- Windows 7- 2 120mm fans (1 included (rear), 1 added in front (mounts behind hard drives)- 1tb wd caviar black hdd, 2 wd ide hdd",2,2,0.0036817594,0.043564394,0.95275384

I had a little trouble getting it turned on at first, but I just had to press a little harder to get my lighter mechanism to turn on. I did almost wreck my car while I was picking songs on my Sansa, but that's because I wasn't paying attention to the road.Even at $50 its a good deal, and sound quality was really fantastic, that was a big fear as I'm pretty picky about music reproduction.

"I mainly shoot at wide angles on my 1.6x rebel xt and didn't have much of a need for a telephoto. However, I wanted to start playing with a telephoto lens and didn't want to splurge the 600-1500$ for a f/2.8 or large zoom telephoto lens without first getting comfortable photographing in the telephoto range. I already had a Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 and was used to excellent sharpness on my photos and fast performance in low light. I researched quite a bit on the Sigma, Tamron and Canon 70-300 for a &lt;200$ lens to fit my low budget. There was no decisive winner amongst the three, and I decided to go with the Sigma because it seemed to have more owners and reviews than the Tamron. The Canon didn't have macro which was a drawback. I found this lens to be a very surprising value and very usable as long as you don't expect too much. I was searching for a low-cost telephoto lens with high IQ sacrificing speed and low-light performance, which is exactly what this lens is about.Some Pros:~~~~~~~a) AF is reasonable for such a large zoom (I guess not fast enough for moving objects). I guess people who complain of slow AF must be comparing it to some f/1.2 lens.b) Works very well indoors using a canon EX 580 II flash (with gold diffuser and tungsten WB) and ISO 1600. Using this combination I am able to get shutter speeds as fast as 1/160 at 300mm. Noise at ISO 1600 is surprisingly low and non-distracting. I was able to use Lightroom to reduce the noise and retain good sharpness.c) Images were reasonably sharp (my Tamron might have been a wee bit sharper, but you are not going to see that difference in 4x6 or 5x7) both at center and edge at 300mm (newspaper test). I can't imagine getting more sharpness from a zoom lens at this price.d) Macro mode significantly reduces the minimum focusing distance.Limitations:~~~~~~~a) Photos typically will require some post-processing. Purists will not bother looking at this lens. I had to twiddle with the color of the images, but the detail was there in the picture. Once fixed, the photos often gave the impression of having been taken with a top quality lens.b) 8*10 quality photos will require a little bit of work depending on lighting conditions.c) large minimum focusing distance.This lens more than served my need for a beginner telephoto lens and will likely stay in the camera bag unless I go in for one of the $$$$ telephotos.",2,2,0.25385568,0.2235884,0.52255595

"I bought this mouse to replace my Logitech G7 (Carbon Black) mouse.  Since receiving it this morning, I've been very happy with this MX1100.  I'll highlight a few things that made this mouse better than my old G7.Ergonomics:I can fully palm the mouse and all but my pinky finger can rest comfortable on the surface area of the mouse.  I have large slender hands so I find that my pinky and fourth finger will stay tight together on the right edge of the mouse as I grip it.  It would have been nice of the right slope could be extended for those of us with larger and longer hands.Buttons:Unlike my G7 which only had one thumb button, this mouse has three (one ""hidden"").  This is great for gaming as I usually use one for voice chat and have found a lack of a second problematic.  I now use the second button as a grenade key and have not yet found a use for the stealth key.Update (1/12/2009): I've been using this mouse for long gaming sessions most days of the week for the past 3 weeks and so far have only used 15% of the two AA alkalines.  At this rate, I figure it'll last me at least another 4 months before I even need to change out the batteries.  Although the box rates it for 9 months battery life, heavy use of the mouse will probably reduce overall battery life down to 5-6 months instead.This is far better than putting a mouse into a charging cradle every day (like the MX1000 or MX Revolution).DPI Switch:Although this mouse only allows you to set two custom DPI settings, it is enough for most of my graphics, general, and gaming use.  It's definitely not as nice as the five DPI setting ability of my old G7, but having a DPI switch with only two settings is still a good compromise.Hyper-Scroll/Micro-Gear Wheel:Unlike the MX Revolution, VX Revolution (and others with the same scroll wheel), this mouse has a button to switch between the indented/click-to-click feel and the smooth scroll feel.  I find this much more reliable than clicking down the mouse wheel.  Another plus is that I still have a middle mouse button unlike that of other Logitech mice with hyperfast scroll.  The mouse wheel button is also far easier to press down than on my G7 which makes it now usable extra button my gaming sessions.Batteries:Unlike other battery powered mice, the MX1100 can run on one or two batteries (hence the same polarity for both batteries in the compartment).  Unlike my G7 where 7-8 hours of gaming would drain the 900 mAh battery, the MX1100 can probably go for a full 248 days before needing a new pair of batteries (number taken from Logitech Setpoint 4.70 with Duracell batteries that came with mouse).Update (4/15/2009): The two included Duracell batteries (2180 mAh @ 1.5v) lasted from 12/20/2008 to 4/12/2009.  That's a total of 103 days of usage (heavy gaming 4 out of 7 days with the rest of the time spent on graphic work, general use, and animation.  There were also a few days where I've left the mouse on overnight, so the two included batteries could have lasted beyond 4 months (approximately 120 days).  I've since replaced the batteries with cheap alkaline ""super duty"" cells from Walgreens.  I only expect about two weeks of total battery life before they die.  If you have the money, invest in some reputable alkalines or rechargeable Ni-MH cells (high capacity ones - 1800 mAh or greater).  Definitely beats having to swap batteries on my old G7 (or plug it into a charger like the MX Revolution).Cost:Lastly, this mouse cost $25 less than my old G7 (~$65 compared to $100).  The feature set is about the same (maybe better depending on viewpoint), but the lower price tag makes this a better deal and a great step-up for me from my G7.",2,2,0.0012708843,0.003191942,0.99553716

"It would seem that my review has turned out to be a sort of comparison of the Sennheiser HD 598s to the HD 600s.  While it wasn't where I intended to go, I think the comparison is valid when deciding if the $200 premium is worth the payout (it is).I have owned/auditioned a ton of headphones over the years, and I currently have a pretty decent assortment in my stable.  But these HD 600s are probably going to have all those other pairs collecting dust.  About a month ago I had purchased a pair of HD 598s and they were the pair of cans that finally sold me on open phones.  I really like the 598s, and they are excellent for classical, jazz, classic rock, and many other genres music.  However, when it came to listening to contemporary popular music they just seemed to come up short.  The HD 600s are a much better ""all around"" headphone, and well worth the additional $200 (in my opinion).  Their superiority was evident from the moment I put them on and plugged them in.  I played Chris Isaac's ""Wicked Game"" and I literally had a chill run up my spine.  More bass than the 598s?  Yes; but it's not unnatural in any way whatsoever.  It just adds to the richness/quality of the overall sound.  These make everything just sound more real, and they seem to do it almost effortlessly.  After listening to the 600s for an extended period and then going back to the 598's, the differences become more noticeable.  Again,  where the 598s start to struggle, the 600s just power through.  I completely understand why so many people consider these to be some of the best phones ever produced.  I have also been tricked into looking around the room for that noise I just heard only to realize it was part of the recording.  If you need to stick to a budget, the 598s are an excellent choice and a fantastic bargain (just watch and wait for the price to dip).  However, if you can afford the premium price, the HD 600s are worth every penny.My listening setup consists of a variety of digital files played from my computer, an Onkyo C-7030 CD player, and a Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  I should also add that I don't use any equalization with my phones.  I messed around running the phones directly off the computer's headphone jack, and I have to say that I highly recommend a good DAC/Amp to get the most out of these cans, as the added power really brings them to life.  And remember that to truly ""Listen"" to these phones you need to be in a quiet environment.A few other observations:  The 600's clamp quite a bit tighter than the 598s, though they do seem to be loosening up a bit with use.  I think the 598s actually sound a bit wider and a touch brighter, but my 600's only have about 15 hours on them at this writing and like the 598s, I expect them to open up after more time.  I may invest in a better cable in the future, but the included cable gets the job done, and it's more flexible than the one for the 598's (which I also replaced).  I had thought about comparing these to some of my other closed phones for my review, but really, I don't feel that any of them even comes close to these 600s. I've also noticed that with the 598's it is important to find that sweet spot in the volume where the sound really starts to shine, while the 600's play much better and more balanced over a wider range of volume (high and low).I am looking forward to enjoying these headphones for many years to come.  If you have any comments or questions I welcome them and will try my best to answer.  I did extensive research prior to this purchase, so if I can't answer a specific question I may be able to point you in the right direction.Update 1:  After probably 20 more hours of listening I can clarify my comment about the 598s being a little bit brighter.  On certain pieces when I hear a high-hat cymbal on the 598's, I hear it as one sound, and mostly the sound of the cymbal.  On the 600's you clearly hear the stick hitting the cymbal, and the sound of the cymbal itself.  So, I would say the high end of the 600s may not be perceived as being as bright as the 598's, but it is much more defined, clear, and controlled.",2,2,0.027090939,0.05829016,0.91461885

If you don't see an update, it's because the sensor (and the related receiver) continue to work as expected.After a couple instances of a side gate in our backyard being left open (either because a member of the family opened it and forgot to close it [never ever me, of course!] or because of a utility person or neighbor kid opening it) I decided I wanted put a stop to it.  I have dogs and am looking to adopt a greyhound and do not want to risk a dog escaping due to a gate that's open (and can't be viewed from the house).  So, the first solution to come to mind was to simply lock the gate.  I wasn't comfortable with this idea, though, because in the event of an emergency it could be challenging to get out of the backyard, also it sounds like kind of a pain (and still, if a member of the family [never ever me!] would open the lock and the gate, there's still no guarantee that they would remember to close and lock it again).  This brought me to the idea of a sensor w/ an indicator of some sort that could, at a glance, tell me whether the gate was open or closed.I looked for a prefab solution for gate monitoring and surprisingly enough, no one markets a system for exterior gates (unless it is part of a pool security system).  So, I started looking at full DIY security/alarm systems.  Many of these seemed to be able to work, but honestly was far more complex and expensive for my simple need.  I finally stumbled onto the skylink monitor system and thought I would give it a shot.  I bought this door sensor for my gate and also bought the garage door monitor.  Both were programmed and installed in less than 10 minutes.Both sensors work as advertised and I have the monitor station set up next to my livingroom TV (which is also viewable from the patio slider door) so whether I am watching evening TV or about to let a dog out into the yard, I can see whether the gate or the garage door is open via LED indicators.  I currently have the audio turned off, but you can also configure the unit to either beep or SCREAM an alarm (it will deafen you if you are in the same room) upon the garage door or gate opening.My home is newer construction and the sensors are each approx. 50' from the receiver, with 1-3 walls in between.  I have not noticed any issues so far with signal reception.So far I am very pleased with this simple, inexpensive, and functional solution.EDIT 1/30/13:  1 Year later, the sensor is still working as desired.  Haven't even had to change a battery yet.  Great purchase.EDIT 11/24/2013:  Nearly 2 years from purchase I had to replace the battery.  Sensor still works great, which is more than I expected having it installed on an outdoor gate not protected or sheltered from the elements in any way.",2,2,0.030388737,0.04597441,0.9236369

"These are good headphones for the price.  The single button works as a mute/unmute button for phone calls and a pause/unpause button for iPhones and Android players.  Multiple clicks get a skip/go back response from android but not from the iPhone 5.I do like the base of the cord, which is covered in braided nylon.  It prevents tangles, but it would have been nice to have the same effect after the cord split.  Tangles are still common there like they are on all headphones.These block out exterior sound quite well and come with several rubber/foam tips to adjust to your ear size.

"Having used the Netgear WNDA3100 and the Cisco AE1000 adapters previously this adapter beats them handsdown.Neither of the previous adapters could maintain near the 300Mbps advertised, they would typically fluctuate between 54 & 150 Mbps (maybe hitting about 200Mpbs on 5mHz channel), but never holding a constant signal. The TrandNet holds 450Mbsp constantly. I am using the Cisco E4200 router (it also performed well on a Neatgear n750 router).Range and signal reception are both FAR better than either of the mentioned USB thumb-tpye adapters.This is the way to go if you need a high speed network connection for streaming or gaming and have a router that supports 450Mbps.",2,0,0.63764703,0.2566831,0.1056699

"I've never installed a TV Wall Mount before, and frankly I was really apprehensive about putting one up - after all, one mistake means that a perfectly good 40"" television could come crashing down!  After reading the instructions and giving it a go, I found that putting up the television with the AmazonBasics Universal Tilt TV Wall Mount was as easy as the instructional video online showed it would be.  It was just a matter of using the included stud finder to find the studs, drilling 4 small holes, screwing in a few screws into the wall and screwing a few screws into the back of the television.  With little effort, we hung up the television and it's still hanging on the wall and hasn't crashed down!  Our television is a 40"" screen - it really looks great on the wall.The tilt on the television mount isn't really necessary, although it is nice if you happened to hang the tv a little too high (which we didn't, so we didn't use the tilt feature).  The mount was really easy to install, and all you need is a drill, a pencil, and a phillips head screwdriver.  Everything else is included in the box!

"First, I love Polk products.  This Sub has been reviewed in large numbers with 5 stars.  I wanted a front firing SW since it's on carpet.  I'm replacing a BIC downfiring V1220.  BIC makes good stuff as well and sounded better so far than this one.I'm having problems getting this sub to work correctly.  It works, but the sound isn't right.  I tried connecting through the LFE and that wasn't very good.  I rewired everything directly from the amp to the sub and back to the speakers.  It's better but still distorts with reasonable volume.  I set my fronts correctly and center, with no change.  I'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong. The sub crossover is set at 120.  I've tried the phase both ways.I tried getting help from Polk customer service.  They are very nice and try to be helpful, but they make suggestions that are very basic and couldn't possibly help.Then out of nowhere, they sent me an email saying if I supply the serial number and purchase date, they will send me a new sub.  I don't think there is anything wrong with this one!  My amp is Yamaha.  It's a great amp but their on screen program for me is diffiult to use. I get it eventually though.

I couldn't be happier.  Super solid, and everything about this tripod oozes quality.  It has some weight to it, so I have zero worry that it'll fall over with a heavier load.

"I ordered these Philips O'Neill on-the-ear headphones through the Vine program and have been putting them through the paces.First off let's address the negatives:~ This is purely an issue of aesthetics, but the retro ""White-Black Check"" design is a bit ostentatious, but there are three other styles to choose from. Given a choice, I would have gone for the more conservative ""Black Ice"" but since I do most of my headphone listening in-doors, this is not a big problem.~ A possible con: The materials, for the most part, are very light-weight plastic. I'm sure that contributes to their light and comfortable fit:  I just don't know how well they'll hold up under normal use. So the ruling on their ""construction"" is open at this time.So, on to what matters: comfort and sound.~ In terms of comfort these may well be the most comfortable ""on-the-ear"" headphones I've ever worn. The pads are a bit small for me, but then again I've got big ears. But as they are very light and the padding is soft, they don't feel tight on your head/ears, and stay nicely in place. They are adjustable: my wife and I needed a different size to get them comfortable and found adjusting them very easy. The fabric tangle-free cable is also a nice change from the standard plastic cables that is the norm with most headphones/ear buds and contributes to the ease of use of these headphones. I've listened for hours and never felt bothered by the fit or feel.~ In terms of sound, I am extremely impressed. I have been trying out all sorts of music on these headphones and whether listening to jazz (Michael Franks, Steely Dan), classical (Bach, Mozart, Copland), or made-for-headphones pop/rock (Alan Parsons Project, Electric Light Orchestra, Pink Floyd), these headphones bring out every nuance and detail in the music. The 40-millimeter drivers deliver a very impressive dynamic range with clear highs which are not at all overly-bright or ""tinny"", a nice mid-range, and rich, clear bass which is hard to come by on headphones. I even tried them out on some 50s-era Sinatra and the brilliant arrangements of Gordon Jenkins, Nelson Riddle and Billy May sound more finely detailed than ever.These headphones are not inexpensive but they're not up there in price with Beats Solo (Dr. Dre), Bose, or Sennheiser either, yet to my ears they sound as good as some of those more expensive models. They are a moderately priced, high performance option that I highly recommend. Get a pair for yourself. They would make a great birthday or Christmas gift for the audiophile on your list too. (Don't forget: go with the ""Black Ice"".)Sound: 5/5Comfort: 4/5Construction: 3?/5Value: 4/5",2,2,0.017081013,0.1696562,0.8132629
"Let me start with saying I have not tested it at 3.0. However, I used it on both 1.1 and 2.0 interfaces, and it worked well. Getting it apart is a chore, and back together is not much easier. However, it appears to be solid, and once it is apart, it is super easy to install the drive. It is very light-weight, and appears to be durable. It comes with a little pouch which holds the enclosure, as well as the cables. That helps to make it a very portable solution. All in all, for the price I don't think you can beat it.",2,2,0.00041507778,0.00484785,0.9947371

"This is second of the three camera bags I have now. My review is after 4 or 5 months of use. I bought this right before my Yosemite workshop and since then also used it for a trip to the capital (DC - only for air travel portion). I am using it to carry Nikon D700, 70-200 2.8, 17-35 2.8, 50mm, 2X teleconverter, spare battery, blower and a few other goodies. Works great. My notebook is Dell E6500 and that won't fit in the notebook compartment. I knew that going in. Not an issue for me but may be for some other folks. I also mount externally my Gitzo tripod. Failry easy to put it on and off. As far as air trvale, AMR didn't give any hassle when I carried it on the plane as my main carry on. Antidote is easy to put on and take off your back in the field. However once off you have to place it on ground or a rock or whatever is nearby to get access to your equipment. Which is different then my Kata sling(30N1 I think), however I find it more convenient this way then I did with Kata. Don't ask me why, but I do find me taking this bag more often for field trips. I would still use Kata, if I was shooting with 17-35 or/and 50mm. For traveling in metro in DC, Antidote was tad too big, I am glad I got a shoulder bag (Retrospective 7) for that. I like that a lot for walking around city/street bag. I am looking at getting second camera body, which will easily fit inside Antidote.

"I looked at the Elites but would have had to order a larger size than what I could practically fit into my living room or else pay a lot more money.  Mustang offered this motorized screen in the exact 92 inch size I needed for a great price.  (Be warned that the housing is a bit wider than the actual screen width.)  I ordered it on Saturday and it arrived on Monday.  Amazon Prime continues to amaze!I installed the screen (these screens are heavy so use 2 people and install very securely!), pressed the button and it smoothly unfurled itself so far it frightened me at first.  I thought it might actually unroll too far and damage the unit.  I hit the &#34;stop&#34; button and the motor stopped instantly and smoothly with no jerk or hesitation.  The remote is nothing short of amazing.  It actually controls the screen from inside a bathroom around a corner from my living room where the screen is installed.  The only thing I wish it had but doesn't is a switch to integrate with my projector to automate the use of the screen.  However, at this price point, that is not much of a consideration and the remote is a snap; hit the button and walk away.I've now been using the screen for over a month.  I spent the time to &#34;micro-adjust&#34; its stopping point in both directions and it is precise to say the least.  Everything about this screen exceeds my expectation, especially with regard to the price.  Friends and neighbors are also very impressed with it.As far as picture quality goes, I notice a definite improvement in it over projecting on a wall.  It has a few variances in the white screen but these in no way detract from the viewing experience and aren't noticeable when in use.

"The idea is basically that the pen captures both the sound and the text you write (or just one or the other if you prefer) and can sync the sound up to the place you wrote.That effectively gives you fast, visually oriented access to audio information.  Your eyes can scan the page to find what you want, rather than hitting fast forward and rewind to find it in audio.  So note taking becomes a matter of putting together a series of visual ""bookmarks"" to guide your access to the audio.If that were all it did, it would be enough.  There is also the ability to send your notes (they call them pencasts) to Evernote, to an email recipient, to Facebook, to Google Docs, to a host of places.  You just draw a horizontal line ""there and back again"" and write your command on it.  And you can shortcut it, so rather than write the email address out each time you can assign the person's first name to the email command and that person's email address and just use the name.  You can set many such shortcuts up.If that were all it did, it would be enough.  It's expandable with apps.  It can support a lookup dictionary.  Launch it.  Write a word.  Get a meaning.  It can support a Spanish/English Dictionary.  There is handwriting recognition software.  And for the true geek, there is a free port of Zork.There is a calculator app right on the pen.  One is built into the books and you tap the numbers.  Or you can launch this one and just write the equation.  Get to the = and it solves it.  Two tricks.  One, to square a number, multiply it by itself.  If you try to superscript it, it reads the superscript as the next digit.  Use * for multiplication.  X doesn't do it.In meetings now I use theKindle Fire, Full Color 7"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fias my lookup tablet, and my Livescribe for fast note taking, and use Evernote to sync between them (a year of premium Evernote came with the pen, and I thought I wouldn't qualify because I am already a subscriber, but it extended my subscription an additional year).

"I know I'm going to sound like I flippantly gave this camera review a ""5"" for every category, but honestly if you can fall in love with a camera...I did. I have had a Canon Rebel (with several lens and expensive flash) for about 5 years now, but this camera makes me want to sell my Canon because it doesn't even begin to compare. This camera screams THE FUTURE of cameras...it does everything I wish my Canon did, including record HD video! The more I explored this cameras qualities the more I drooled. I can't say enough about the features, quality and ease of use. It's taken me years to learn how to use my camera more professionally and not just shoot in automatic, but this camera has the best of both worlds---it's got super options, but is easy enough for your technically challenged friends to use.PROS:-Easy to set up-Extremely lightweight (compared to my Canon Rebel)-Can attach a external flash-Zooms from 24-720mm (you can literally be right up on an object vs 6 inches away, and you can clearly capture objects far away in the distance)-Huge view screen-You can take the pictures by using the view screen (like a point n shoot camera) unlike most professional cameras I've used-You can adjust the aperture while actually seeing how it will effect the object you are shooting without having to do test shots-Menus are easy to navigate-I didn't even read the manual and was able to figure out all the features-Helpful hints that pop up (great for someone unfamiliar with camera terms)-You can shoot Panoramic shots (180 degrees)-You can switch easily from pictures to HD video (with a 4G card in I can record 30 minutes)-Uploading photos was just as simple as my Canon-Picture quality amazingThis is the perfect camera who wants to shoot higher quality pictures, but is afraid of all the scary adjusting required by other non-point and shoot cameras.CONS:-Can't buy other lens to attach...however who needs to? It's ranging of adjustment is so great you literally save money here by never needing to buy any other attachments!",2,2,0.17317021,0.06887336,0.75795645

"I owned both the original CoolStream, and the CoolStream duo.My iPod speaker is the Altec Lansing iMT620, which has great sound and a rechargeable battery for portable music.Similar to the original CoolStream, this can play music through the iPod interface. It has definite improvements over the original CoolStream in the fact that it uses the new Bluetooth protocols, so no passcode is required. Annoyingly, I don't think it ever turns off but the light is a very limited LED and so it is not a bother.An issue with the iMT620 is that it does not detect the Coolstream Duo as playing music when it's on battery mode. The iMT620 has a 'feature' to automatically turn off after a few minutes. To resolve this I used the included 1.5' 3.5mm audio cable and connected to the auxillary feature of the iMT620, which disables the auto-off feature. It still charges through the iPod dock but now has an awful cable. This is a common problem with the iMT620 and some iPhone/iPod features will do the same thing to the iMT620.Overall, the CoolStream Duo's battery is precisely what was needed and is worth the upgrade over the original CoolStream.

"The Touch Cover is really part and parcel of the Microsoft Surface RT experience, so if you're interested in how everything comes together, you should see the review I left on the Microsoft Surface with Windows RT 32 GB (Tablet only) page.  This cover is really something else though, and hats off to Microsoft for an excellent idea.PROS+ The part you actually care about: will it type?  The answer is yes, it will-- but you are going to have to give it a bit of time and effort.  I've found that the less I treat it as something ""different,"" the better the Touch Cover responds.  Since I touch type anyway, I'm never really looking down at the keyboard, and if I let my fingers fall where they would on a laptop with flat keys, hey presto, you're looking at 70 - 90 wpm after about two weeks (Microsoft says the adjustment period is about four to five days; it took me around three to get up to speed, but that's a question of how much you use it).  However, holding down the [Shift] key (and striking [A], for some reason) will definitely take some real getting used to.  There are, thankfully, two indentations on the [F] and [J] keys to signal the home row.  Much appreciated, Microsoft.+ The mouse input and two-finger scroll work surprisingly well, although in Windows RT the scroll orientation is locked to ""reverse"" (or in Apple-speak, ""natural"") scrolling, which can be frustrating for some.  I'd suggest using tap to click instead of trying to wrestle with the two pressure-sensitive buttons.+ Touch recognition works great.  If you're just resting your fingers on the cover, there won't be any input onto the screen-- a light to firm tap will do the trick.+ It's a good cover.  The material feels good in the hand, and it protects every part of the screen.  While some people have reported trouble with the edges fraying, I'm several weeks in now and with constant usage haven't seen any problems.+ You get a spacious, well-sized keyboard.  Each key is a comfortable distance from its neighbors, and the raised surfaces make it easy to find where one ends and the next begins.  The keys themselves are of a similar size to those on a laptop, so you won't have too much difficulty striking them -- once you get used to the learning curve.+ Insanely portable.  This is, for me, the main differentiating factor between the Surface RT with a Touch Cover, and theASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue).  The keyboard dock on the TF300T adds a substantial amount of bulk and alters the form factor of the device; you're either carrying a netbook or a tablet.  The nature of the Touch Cover means that you're carrying a tablet at all times, that happens to be able to grow a keyboard whenever convenient.  Naturally, you're not getting physical keys, additional ports, or a backup battery, but the Surface does well enough on these fronts anyway.+ Strong, firm connection.  The iPad's Smart Cover also attaches via magnets, but it can skate around a bit on the tablet before locking in.  With a Touch Cover, you know when you're good to go by the loud, sharp snap when it attaches.  This connection is strong enough (if you hear the snap) to support the tablet, even if you wave the cover around a bit (I'd swing your new Surface over a bed though; accidents happen).+ Excellent software integration.  Microsoft threw in some smart touches that polish up the experience: attaching a Touch Cover to a Surface changes the background color of the start screen to match (this can be easily overriden), and the software keyboard will appear and disappear depending on the position of the Touch Cover.  For example, when the cover's flipped to the back of the tablet, it's disabled so you don't press any keys by mistake, and tapping on an input field will bring up the onscreen keyboard.+ Sturdy material with thoughtful use-cases.  The idea is that when you're not using the keyboard, you can flip around to the back of the device to hold (which isn't noticeable, since the cover is so thin), or prop the kickstand up on it to keep everything compact and out of the way.+ Super convenient.  I really can't stress how much having a flip-out, decent keyboard changes how you interact with a tablet; web addresses are easier to get in, writing and shooting off e-mails becomes feasible (without wrestling with an on screen keyboard), and if you ever wind up using a remote desktop connection, having this and a mouse is perfect.  Also, Office.  Hello, mobile homework!CONS- No magnetic closure.  Microsoft's design team said they wanted the Surface to be like a book, easy to open at any time with no resistance.  That's great in theory, especially if the tablet is lying around the house, but the iPad's Smart Cover has magnetic closure, and no one's complained yet.  The big issue with the cover is that it's prone to flopping open at times, such as in your bag (where you don't want the screen to be on), or when you're just moving the tablet around.  Since the cover's not feather-light, don't think it's going to go flapping around in a mild breeze, but I do wish there were at least a weak magnet to hold the thing shut.- Lousy, lousy, lousy touchpad.  I don't think this is a huge dealbreaker given the beautiful screen on the Surface RT, but using the touchpad, while precise and tolerable for some tasks, is just silly over the long term.  Use that USB port for a proper wireless mouse-- again, while the built in one is quite alright for occasional use, any significant Office work will beg a real mouse.- There are some places where Microsoft didn't go far enough.  Thoughtfully, the design team placed extra sensors below the space bar in case people strike below the raised key, but if anything those sensors should have extended further down; I often miss spaces because my thumbs are hitting below the target.- Nothing will change the fact that the Touch Cover makes using modifier keys, like [SHIFT] or [CTRL] downright awkward.  You're holding down one finger on a button that doesn't actually exist, so if the Surface doesn't register you're holding [SHIFT] you have no tactile way of knowing that and will wind up with a typo.- Some weird input lag.  This is frustrating, because I can't tell if it's a hardware limitation or a software one, but when you're typing you'll occasionally find the device lagging hard, to the point where you can watch as individual letters march out onto the screen.  It's bizarre, and what keeps me from embracing the Surface as a 100% productivity machine.- It's hard to use on a non-flat surface.  I haven't had too much issue using my Surface on my lap, but because the keyboard weighs nothing the tablet will be tempted to rock back a little (shifting the viewing angles, though as they're quite fantastic this isn't a big problem).  More importantly though, if the cover's not on a flat surface it will ""bounce"" a bit on each keystroke, making it hard to type accurately.On the whole though, I really do like the Touch Cover, and if you're going for a Surface RT I really cannot recommend it enough.  It completes the experience, and vastly elevates the Surface from a tablet that's (in my opinion; you can read my reviews on theASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue)or theHP TouchPad Wi-Fi 16 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer(with theHP TouchPad Wireless Keyboard) as comparison points, along with other tablets I own such as the Asus Google Nexus 7 Tablet (8 GB) - Quad-core Tegra 3 Processor, Android 4.1,Apple iPad MC705LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black), or Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1) very, very good compared against its competitors, to a mobile productivity machine with enormous potential.Of course, the Type Cover may be worth looking at if you intend to, well, type a lot, as well as two other options.  First, Microsoft will be licensing the specification for the magnetic port the Touch Cover uses, so expect to see third party accessories, keyboards, and cases in short order.  Second, and let me reiterate again: the Surface has a USB 2.0 port!  Use it!  If you have a USB wireless (or wired) keyboard, feel free to stick it in when the mood strikes you-- they behave flawlessly.I'd also recommend buying direct from Microsoft, as you'll get the cover for less, in a selection of colors, and have the option of looking at a type cover if you'd like.  Sellers on Amazon are price gouging right now to take advantage of limited availability.As with my other reviews, I will update and respond to comments and questions as necessary.

"I bought this to split my coax cable TV connection to my TiVo and a Motorola tuning adapter.  I decided to experiment with this to solve an annoying problem - the SDV channels would drop on occasion due to low signal strength.  The channels had come in fine with the cable company's own box when I had it (go figure!) and apparently tuning adapters are far more sensitive so I thought that the use of an amplifier (along with avoiding using the tuning adapter as a pass-through) would keep those channels from dropping out.The result - no dropouts thus far.  Every time I have changed to an SDV channel, it has come up.  Also, the tuning adapter seems to receive the data signal from the cable company a bit faster after a power failure.As others have noted, keep in mind that, although the AC adapter is included, the necessary coax cable to connect it to the amplifier is not, so be sure to have one available for that.",2,2,0.014387703,0.03036241,0.9552499
"I shoot competitively and one of the guys got these a few months before I took the plunge, inspired by his great almost down the barrel views.  These do perform quite well, with great 1080 hi-res video only impaired by some white balance or other color issues.  It doesn't compete with overall image quality of my high-res camcorder, but I didn't expect it to.  The first time I tried to start them I couldn't get it to respond right, so followed the instructions to use the reset button, and ever since has been performing well.A few things.  First, the glasses aren't adjustable, and I've got a big head, so they were painful behind the ears at first, but they seem to have adjusted to me.  Still, I wear my regular shooting glasses up until I'm about to be called, then switch to these.  Second, you don't have any kind of indicator that they're running, so I keep forgetting to turn them off, until they get a little uncomfortable and I remember they're there.  No problem as far as my editing software allows me to easily trim off the excess, but could be an issue if you're in a situation pushing the battery life or memory capacity.  Thirdly, today for the first time I had a lens pop out when I dropped them onto my shooting bag, not exactly a hard surface.  I popped them back in and they didn't come out while shooting, but I'm hoping that doesn't get worse.  Lastly, when you fold them up to put them back in their supplied protective case, be sure you fold them with the right side folded over the left side so the power button (which is on the right) doesn't get pressed in by the left arm.If you've been using hat mounted cameras I think you'll find this quite an improvement, both for the placement of the lens, being less likely to be mis-aimed (cap a little cock-eyed), etc.  Overall, I recommend this product fairly strongly.",2,2,0.00067503995,0.0047596544,0.99456525

"I was in the market for a high end noise canceling headphones as my old Sony NC Headphones died out. As with all of my other electronics purchases, I perform a thorough research before making a final decision. Although the old Sony ones cost me $50 back when new, they performed exceptionally well. I bought a pair of the Ultimate Ears Triple Fi 10 Earphones back when Amazon had it on sale for $99. The UE are the BEST pair of earphones I've ever owned and were the top choice for flights. Although they were not active noise canceling, they sealed out most of the ambient noise including dramatically reducing Air Cabin noise. My UE Triple Fi were taken on a long airplane trip by my wife to visit my in-laws, but on the way back, she left them there. T.T :(Back to the search and it came down to either the Bose Quiet Comfort or these Sony ones. The Bose obviously are well known and received raving reviews. However, the deciding factor was the difference of price. The $100 difference made a huge difference. Given the fact that I was very happy with the previous Sony pair that died and so I decided to take the plunge. After receiving the package from Amazon, I used the included battery and test out the headphones. They seemed at first glance to be solidly built and felt very comfortable. Music was much better with the noise canceling on as the other reviewers stated. With the NC off, music sounded bland, like it was missing the ooomph.Now for the test. I was on a long International flight and it gave me a real chance to test these babies out. For 14 hours, I had these things on and they drowned out most of the noise, but some noise was still audible. Taking a pad off one ear and putting it back on, you can really tell that the NC mechanics really do a great job. My ears not being exposed to so much noise made it easier for me to catch some z's. However, where the problem occurred was the comfort. I wear glasses and the pressure the pads caused on my ears were unbearable after about a few hours. I had to take them off every 20 minutes to massage my ears. After taking off my glasses and falling asleep, the pressure from the pads were better relieved. I still took them off almost every hour to massage my ears.After thinking about it, it must have been the temples of my glasses pressing on to the back of my ears and on my skull from the weight of the pads. I tested the headphones with my glasses off days after my trip and I still felt pain in my ears being pressed on to my skull for too long.PROS:+ Great noise canceling performance (so necessary on flights)+ Active noise canceling monitoring system (changes noise canceling frequency depending on situation)+ Monitor Button (to cut the noise canceling function and music to hear stewardesses and activity going on)+ Amazing music reproduction+ Works without noise canceling on (YES!)+ Comes with nice carrying case and airplane adapter+ Foldable for easy storageCONS:- Uncomfortable after long use (read review above)- Music loses oomph factor without noise canceling on- Battery Life on the short sideAlthough $200 is a lot for headphones, the main purpose of these headphones are to cancel out ambient noise and for that I give it 5 stars for doing it well. Took off a star for the discomfort. Before making your decision, try to see if over ear instead of on-ear headphone (like these) will be better for you.UPDATE 8/17/2012After 5 months of moderate use, the cable has become unusable as there were tears on one of the ends. Luckily, Sony was able to replace the cable without much hassle. I will have to send the old cable back and wait for the replacement. Right now, I am using a Mediabridge 3.5mm to 3.5mm male to male headphone cable, which seems to do the job as a temporary replacement. The ends are too fat to fit in to the phone jack on the left ear and so it will fit perfectly. If your cable get slit or damaged from use, make sure to call Sony 1800-222-7669 for a replacement within the 1 year parts warranty. I also noticed that the headphones were eligible for a exchange for a flat fee of $25. That gives me re-assurance that Sony is willing to stand behind their products. The headphones are well built and keeps on going, but it's the cable that's not.UPDATE 9/14/2012Sony sent me the wrong item. Instead of sending me the replacement cable, they sent me the Airline dual jack adapter. Now, I have 2 of them. I will be sending it back on Monday to get this thing straightened out. I DID tell them it is the cable many many times. It may be a simple mistake, but it surely is annoying. However, I still use the Mediabridge Cable instead and it has absolutely been nothing, but great. The headphones are still going strong without any issues except the cable.UPDATE 11/30/2012Still no cable. Sony hasn't sent me a replacement cable as of yet, but they keep sending me reminders of surveys about the warranty claim. Mediabridge cable is still holding up well. In fact, it makes the headphones look MUCH better and is much more durable.",2,2,0.003266264,0.005801673,0.9909321

"The Audio Technica (AT)Sonic Sport earphones I have been using are higher priced and do not provide half as much sound as the Brainwavz S1. Most noticeable is the full, rich bass range, an area almost non-existent with the AT set.  The difference is truly marked and really leaves the more expensive set in the dust.The great expansive sound is not muddy - it is crisp and clear and avoids a personal grievance - an overall tinny sound with an almost painfully piercing upper range. It seems like small earphones like these are either indistinct or too sharp, but this set is well balanced.I listened to a bunch of different types of music, including The Roches pure acapella along with vocal powerhouse Beth Hart. Then I moved into blues guitar wizards like Joe Bonamassa, Eric Clapton, Gary Moore, Jeff Beck, Jack White, Gary Clark, Jr. and Stevie Ray Vaughn. I ended my test with some Beethoven and Tchaikovsky along with Zeppelin and the Foo Fighters. Nothing I heard disappointed me.And, although it is not recommended to use the earphones for more than one hour at a time, the first time I tried them out I spent three hours listening to one selection after another and did not experience the slightest bit of discomfort. They fit tightly with a good seal, producing a strong bass.The flat ribbon wire curved behind my ear easily. This placement kept it neatly out of my way, and it also helped the earpieces remain secure in the ear canal as I moved around. That flat ribbon also avoided another annoyance of mine - tangled wires.  No more wasted time spent on untangling tiny earphone wires.The set fit me perfectly right out of the box, but additional tips are included so the correct fit can be achieved. A small sturdy zippered hard case is included to safely store the set and house the extra tips and handy airplane adapter. Color is subjective, but I liked the muted yet distinctive hues. It works for both sexes.I am impressed, and the only changes I would suggest would be to make the Left and Right notation on the earpieces easier to read, and shave down the profile of the plastic encasing the plug because it was a tight fit when the iPod I was sitting in a cradle.

"After reading some of the comments on this cover, I was more than a little nervous about ordering one for my new Kindle, but given my ability to drop things, I knew I needed one, and I do like to read before I go to sleep, so a light was something I was interested in.  So, I took the plunge, and I'm glad I did.  It's not perfect, and it may be that my expectations were tempered, but the cover meets my expectations, though it was a bit expensive.I was looking for a cover that didn't add a huge amount to the overall bulk of the Kindle, but would provide decent protection from my butterfingers, cover the screen when I travel, provide sufficient light for reading, and access for charging.  This cover, so far, has all of those features.  The leather is thin, sure, but leather has an inherent durability, and I don't need a motorcycle jacket.  The rubber bumper surrounding the Kindle has survived the first drop (as has the Kindle) without damage or mark of any kind.  The Kindle remains securely in the cover, unlike some cell phone covers I've had where the phone wanted to spring loose at the most inopportune times.As far as the design of the light goes - it's not perfect, but it works.  It's a reasonably bright LED that generates no heat and that hasn't had any significant impact on battery life for me.  Yes, staring into the bulb is easy to do, but I have not had any difficulty in angling the kindle slightly away from me - shielding the bulb completely.  The nature of the e-ink in the Kindle's display allows for off-angle viewing with (for me) no significant loss of readability, so while it's not going to be everything to everyone, it's a great compromise between portability, battery life, and brightness.  I'm sure that a clip-on light would be better for some, but I didn't want to deal with that.If you're looking for a perfect reading light - this is not your cover.  If you are looking for a Fort Knox in which to place your Kindle, this is not your cover, either.  If you're looking for a reasonable cover in which you can protect your Kindle from a lot of common mishaps, have a reading light readily accessible when you need it and out of the way when you don't, this may be the cover for you.",2,2,0.0005263266,0.0032986423,0.99617505
"If you have anApple Wireless Keyboardand want to take it everywhere your iDevice goes (and let's face it, who doesn't, or what's the point of having one?), then this is a very useful accessory to have. The Apple keyboard is surprisingly sturdy considering how thin and delicate-looking it is, but I still wouldn't just want to shove the thing into my bag unprotected. I was looking for the perfect case that would give plenty of protection to the keyboard without adding too much bulk, as I didn't want to find myself carrying so much junk around that I may as well have just taken my laptop. I thought this case looked like it should do the job, and I wasn't disappointed. It's really nicely-made with a tough canvas exterior and a thick polar fleece lining that gives plenty of snug cushioning to the keyboard. The flap is secured with a velcro tab on each end. The case is exactly what I needed: thick enough to ensure that my keyboard is protected from damage (although you still have to be careful how you pack it as it's not a ""hard shell"" type of case so won't protect against bending or crushing) but still slim enough to tuck easily into a bag when packing without taking up too much space.The version of this case that I bought is theblackone, but I see it's currently unavailable at the time of writing this review.",2,2,0.00038352728,0.0044014473,0.99521494

"IPS vs TN was a constant debate for me for a few months. My old Asus monitor was starting to show its age and I wanted a new main monitor.For months I was watching BenQ 144 hz, 1 ms monitors to go on sale. The problem is those are TN which (while better than they used to be) have issues with colors. I asked around and looked at reviews and ended up with this guy.My use is mostly working from home in medical billing. I spend most of my time looking at multiple excel spreadsheets and websites for work. This monitor is larger enough that I can use a split screen to have 2 different spreadsheets on the screen at the same time and read them both. And have another on my other monitor. Effectively giving me 3 monitors for work.Gaming. I am a gamer but not much of an FPS gamer and definitively and pro. The reduced latency of a high end TN is nice. But since the only speed intensive games I play are an occasional ARPG or RTS, I'd rather have a bit less speed and a monitor that looks nicer. My video card is only a GTX460 so chances are I was not going to be getting above 60 FPS in most AAA titles anyway.In the end I decided that in order to justify a high end BenQ monitor I'd need a new video card. A GTX770 was out of my budget right now and in the near future I'd be looking at the new 800 series. I decided that this IPS fulfills my needs, without needing an immediate upgrade, and looks darned nice.My only concern was I recently swore off Asus products. I had some major issues with customer support for an RMA on a motherboard. But this monitor looked (by far) the best for my budget at the size I wanted without having too much latency. So I'm giving their monitors another chance even if I'm now more of an MSI motherboard fan.",2,2,0.01418248,0.049490698,0.9363268

"I've only had the battery a few days, so I can only give my first impressions (though if necessary I will update this review). The battery came in a plastic blister pack, heat-sealed all the way around. I cut it out and placed it in my Insignia flash HD (NS-DCC5HB09) camcorder (from Best Buy but now discontinued), and it fit perfectly. Next, I gave the battery a full charge (through the camcorder), and it seems to be working all right. The camcorder came with only one battery and replacement batteries from Best Buy in-store cost about three times the price on Amazon. The battery is rated at about 90 minutes for this camcorder, but with an 8GB SD card the camcorder is capable of storing more than 4 hours of HD video, so a second battery makes sense for extended video recording, or simply as a backup. The battery works, but I think a main consideration for anyone thinking about getting a second, proprietary battery for devices these days is how long you intend to use your device or whether the battery is compatible with any other device (lithium-ion batteries can last a long time).",2,2,0.0043518576,0.009432184,0.98621595

"I bought this product because my partner ""vetoed"" an iPod purchase as too expensive.  Less than half the cost of a 20G iPod to start with, plus rebate, plus Gold Box discount, made it a no-brainer.I received the unit today and charged it up.  It already had several sample MP3s on it, not to my taste, but enough to tell it worked.  I had already ripped several hundred MP3s to my hard drive, using MusicMatch, paying good attention to the directory structure created and fixing it up where necessary.  So I first tried to copy them over using the MusicMatch ""synchronize"" feature.  It was taking forever and not preserving the directory structure, so I stopped that and just copied all the files over with Windows Explorer.  Easy easy and fast - took all of about 10 minutes.  Worked fine - there were all of my artists, albums and tracks.  Then I got brave and downloaded RockBox to the unit - it worked fine from the first moment, it is somewhat easier to use, and I think the sound quality is better than with the Archos firmware.  With either set of firmware, you do need to review the manual - while RockBox is more flexible, it's still not 100% intuitive.  I wish both manuals were written by native English speakers, which they're clearly not.  I also wish the RockBox manual was written by a non-techie, but with a bit of reference to the various RockBox mailing lists and forums all is relatively understandable.  It's no iPod in terms of interface, but it seems to work.The unit itself is smaller than I expected, but heavier than it looks.  It'll fit in a pocket, though.  I expected a cheap feel, but it's actually pretty solid.  Other than the headphones, which are dreadful.  I switched them out for a pair of Sennheiser PCX250s that I usually use for traveling with my laptop, and am much happier.  I'll have to buy something else for day to day use with the unit.The hard drive in the unit does sound a bit funky when it spins up for a major operation - which some seem to say may be a precursor to problems.  We'll have to see how the thing holds up.  But with 20G for such a low price, I can put up with a lot.",2,2,0.004153351,0.0061514247,0.9896952
"Every time I went to Sears I would see the Livio Radio on display and saw how it works and decided I would someday purchase one. Well, one day I was in Sears and saw they had a closeout sale of the last one without the power supply and the remote, just the radio. It normally sold for $199 but was marked down to $169 then to $99 then to $69 for the last one. I asked for the manager and he lowered it to $19.98 because it was missing parts. When I got home I found I had a 10.8v, 1.5amp matching transformer power supply I kept from a Verizon modem. Now I have a perfect working Livio Radio like new for $20 bucks.

"I bought this television for my Wife's craftroom for Christmas.  She didn't want a 1080 HD so I looked through the discounted 720p 32"" LCD televisions.  I had it narrowed down to this Toshiba model and a Samsung.  The Toshiba had several good reviews not only about the picture quality but the sound as well - so I bought it.Other reviewers have commented on the picture quality and what settings to use to get the best picture.  Apparently, it you leave it on an eco power saving setting, the picture looks washed out.  I followed their advice and did get a good picture.  Eventhough this TV is a 720, it does have good color and picture clarity.What I like about this TV is:- It's light weight.  I mounted it on a wall mount that swivels.  I was able to lift it onto the mount very easily.- It has 2 HDMI connections plus several others; I've since plugged my wife's computer into the television and will also connect it to a Directv receiver.- The genaric wall mount fit the TV with no problems.- Amazon discounted this TV to a good price.I really can't think of any negatives so I will recommend this television as a good solid purchase at the discounted price.",2,2,0.032824777,0.21183887,0.75533634

"This is the single greatest flash drive I've ever used. I'm using it as a boot drive to run a separate instance of OSX Mavericks, so that I don't have to travel with both my work and personal laptops, and can instead, &#34;borrow&#34; one machines hardware without ever really touching it. This is a setup I've been trying to achieve (off and on, for one reason or another) for a few years now, and every single external drive (usb2, usb3, thunderbolt) I've attempted to throw at the problem has failed miserably. OSX Is just too IO intensive to run from an external drive... until now. The SanDisk Extreme 64GB USB 3.0 (super generic name for super outstanding product) is basically a laptop-grade SSD. It's not as fast as the SSD in my macbook pro (over usb how could it be), but it's the first drive where this setup has ever been usable (actually the first to get anywhere even close).The setup is fully encrypted using FileVault2 and running everything I normally run on my personal laptop (dropbox, pathfinder, launchbar, homebrew, xcode, android studio &#60;-- yeah, i said android studio, and it's totally usable, just a little slow to start, sourcetree, etc).

"Considering the sharpness, it is the best in its class even at f/2.8 or f/22.As many reviews said, it is even better than a prime wide angle lens.The bad thing is big and unlockable lens cap. It might become loose when you use it for a long time. In addition, the cap can scratch the lens built-in hood.The use of filter is also the problem. However, you can use cokin x-pro filter on it. I use it without a holder. It can just fine. you have to aware of the back reflection on the filter. Now Cokin also offers universal adapter with their holder for 14-24mm, but the price is non sense ($600).Anyways, I still love this lens.

"I recently purchased the TomTom Via 1405, 4.3 inch GPS unit as an upgrade to a 2007 vintage TomTom One, Third Edition.  I was planning an extensive road trip through Canada and wanted something a bit newer, faster and bigger.  I also wanted the ""lifetime map updates"" which are a popular, inexpensive addition at the time of purchase now-a-days.  The purchase through Amazon was a piece of cake - as usual.Some impressions - the unit is light, well put together and starts up fast.  However, I noticed right away that even with the screen brightness turned all the way up, this unit is noticeably dimmer than the old TomTom One.  On the dash, in the right lighting, it is very difficult to see.  I never had that problem with the old unit.  Second - the power plug has changed from the widely available, familiar ""Mini-USB"" to the less available ""Micro-USB"".  Also, the port is in a recessed hole, making some aftermarket charge cables difficult if not impossible to use.  The included non-coiled Micro USB power cord is quite long.  My dash mount is about 15 inches from my cigarette lighter plug so I have about 3 feet of extra cable to deal with.  I have tried two different coiled, shorter Micro USB 12v power cables but neither have worked properly with the unit.  One I had to shave down quite a bit to get a proper fit but it still would not work right.  On the old TomTom One, you could use just about any Mini USB cable to power it.Another annoyance is that the unit, when mounted on the dash (not hanging from the window) causes the ""L"" ended stock cable to point up in the air before making a 180 degree turn to drop down to the cigarette plug.The new mount is totally built into the back of the unit.  My experience is that the rubber suction cup gives up it's grip long before the unit quits working.  I am making it a point to un-stick the mount every time I park the car for more than a few minutes.  It does not look like this suction cup will be easy to replace.  The mount itself seem to hold well on a clean surface although it does not place the unit very far from the windshield.  Any radical angle causes the side of the frame to touch the glass.The Via units also use a new software interface to connect with TomTom for updates, etc.  I do not like it compared to the older TomTom Home software.  The new interface is a connection to a web page.  It does not allow for remote operation of the unit, like the old TomTom Home did and it is confusing to install updates, initialize your map subscriptions, etc. It took me several tries to get my lifetime map subscription up and running and it felt like I happened on the solution by accident.  Thinking back, I can't remember what I did to get it to happen but after several attempts, it just worked all of a sudden.For those who are familiar with the older TomTom units, the new interface is nice.  It now shows street and POI's in proper style - no more all lower case names, etc.  The map routing is quick and easy to understand.  A frequent route I take is now listed correctly the first try in lieu of the custom routing  I used to have to invoke to get it to work on the One series.  The POI database is up to date for the most part and quick & easy to operate.  Complicated interchanges are now displayed in a clear, temporary display which give very precise lane guidance, etc.All in all - I still like the TomTom units.  I was quite surprised at some of the steps backward I feel the new units have taken however.  I think TomTom has to work on the software interface and would like to see the Via units incorporated into the older TomTom Home stand alone software package...",2,0,0.47330436,0.3130676,0.21362802

"First off, as a side-note, the aesthetics on this router are really impressive, and the packaging is very easy to open without much frustration at all.  Immediately, this router is ready to work the minute you take it out of the box, and it looks so pretty on a desk with its shiny, carbon-fiber-esque case a valuable addition to any workspace.Now, for the drive itself, it's a pretty no-frills item- you're not getting some ultra-hyped software or truly innovative system.

"In the past, I've purchased SanDisk Sansa players, like the very affordableSanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Black), so my kids can listen to their MP3s, and so I don't pay a crazy amount of money for Apple's iPods.  This MP3 player is more expensive than the Sansa Clip, but it's a really sweet little MP3 player.  It's very thin, and the color screen is larger than other Sansa player's I've purchased.  Battery life seems on par with what I've normally seen, that is, you can use this player for hours and hours between charging it.  It's such a nice unit, in fact, that my oldest son, upon seeing his sister's new Fuze, began wanting a Sansa Fuze to replace his older, perfectly functioning Sansa player from a few years ago.  The Fuze is smaller, lighter, and has a bigger screen display over earlier models which adds to its appeal.  I think the sound coming from the Fuze is great (but then, I think the same thing about all the MP3 players I've bought).For children, I think the Sansa players are a terrific choice.  They're not very expensive, so when they get lost or broken -- as they often seem to do in the hands of my two daughters -- I don't cringe.  A co-worker had that cringing feeling when his son's iTouch broke just outside its warranty period.Using the Fuze is simple as always.  It's easy to sync music to it using Windows Media Player, and it's easy to navigate the menu system.

"I just received this lens and made a test shot I've made with other lenses.  I took a shot of a satellite dish over a half a block away.  Handheld.  Magnifying it with Photoshop not only can I see the 'Dish Network' clearly, but magnifying a little more I can read the 'TM' underneath the logo. Clear as a bell.This lens is a vast improvement over the 170-500 model.  I used that lens on a wildlife trip and had to jack up the ISO to 800-1600 to get decent shutter speeds and a clear picture.  Unfortunately that introduced noise, really bad in some shots.  The D300 is much better than the D200 in that regard, but the lens was pretty much unusable without a tripod.  This lens will alleviate any of those problems.I usually buy Nikon lenses.  This and the Sigma earlier models including the 170-500 (which I had to buy for a trip and now I'm selling) are the only lenses I could find that gave a substantial difference over the Nikon 70-300 VR.  The Nikon 80-400 VR is $[...] and focuses slowly, and you can pretty much just crop to achieve the 100mm difference (I tried it to be sure.)I'm looking forward to using this with a 1.4 teleconverter, you lose autofocus and 1 stop, can only go down to 100mm but get a 35mm equivalent of 1050mm!  For only $[...]!The quality of the lens is very good.  There is zero zoom creep.  Autofocusing is fast, though just a tad off (a few pixels off on the 'TM' -  could be the camera, and that can be adjusted.)  Manual focusing is tricky with the tripod collar on, it blocks the focusing ring so either move your hand to the top, slide your hand in between the lens and collar, or take the collar off.  I got perfect focus using the viewfinder indicator as a reference point.  The finish is of high quality, but a little strange.  The whole lens including the hood is coated in some kind of flat black matte textured finish, makes me think of a stealth bomber.I did a lot of research to find this lens, and was waiting for it since it's introduction 2 or more months ago.  There is just no Nikon equivalent without buying a f/4 400mm with a TC-17 for about $5000 or so.  If Nikon had a lens at 500-600mm for not too bad of a price hit I would have bought it.  After playing with this lens just a little bit I'm glad I bought it.  I'm fiercely loyal to Nikon, and it's arguably a better product, but I can afford to buy this lens 5 times over if it breaks, and it also saves the whole price of 2 photography workshops/tours.There will probably be a lot of testing and comparing of this lens.  None of that matters to me as it passed the satellite dish test with flying colors, I didn't even know the TM was there before today.Edit 3/16/09 - I recently bought the Sigma 1.4 teleconverter to go with this lens.  The 1st time I really used the combo was during the adding of the spire to the Trump Tower in Chicago.  I was on the 7th floor of a building 1-1/2 miles away measured by Google Maps.  I could see the men waiting in the spire for the next section to arrive.  I had to back way off on the lens to get the tower and the helicopter lowering the sections into the frame.  I lost autofocus, but it was no big deal to focus manually visually or with the in-focus indicator.  Unfortunately I had to shoot through a dirty window, and it was pretty hazy, so the shots aren't that great but I don't blame the lens, the shots are better than anybody else got.Edit 3/18/10 - Added Trump Tower picture to product images.",2,2,0.002771361,0.011627532,0.9856011
"Love this speakers for portability and practicality. The 2 speakers fold into a black sleek brick. Ships with 4 ""AAA"" batteries. One of the features I like the most with tiny portable speakers is a built-in cable, that way you do not have to carry an extra cable as with other speakers that I have. The cable can be tucked away inside the battery compartment when not in use. Although it is only 6 inches long, it comes with an extra 3-feet extension cable.Sound is decent enough and loud enough for such a tiny pair of speakers. Nice sound for a quiet bedroom. An MP3 player and a tiny folding speaker, how much more simple can it be? I also have a puck Altec Lansing Orbit speaker which I also adore. I will using both of them alternately depending on my mood.Box is very plain with just the Motorola logo and the model name.

"There are lots of great features with this package. It is a powerful Wi-Fi AP. It is very fast wired gigabyte router. It looks cool.It offers 2 USB 2.0 ports and ftp and print server features.  Some of the USB features are hard to use. I could not use the printer with more than one PC using the software provided on the CD.  You have to log in as admin if you want to disconnect a USB drive.The web interface is not very user friendly. The router seems to need things set all the time. Or you will be logged in because something stopped working. There are places where the router uses default values that defy setting.The manual is written in broken English and is hard to follow at times.The router runs a flavor of Linux or BSD and has to be rebooted when changing many of the settings. It takes about 60 seconds to reboot.I am not able to connect to my company VPN since switching to this router. I really have no clue what to do for this. Maybe set up one of the Wi-Fi networks for AP mode like at Starbucks, or I'll be spending more time there when I work from home.It is really fast and gets good room coverage, even sitting 18 inches from a 21 inch CRT that shields the wireless printer on the other side the low band 802.11g WPA gets five bars. 12 feet away, across the room, my laptop also gets 5 bars on the same band.  I have not been able to connect to the 5GHz WLAN with the IEEE 802.11n adapters I currently own. The documentation says that all adapters have to be dual band IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n WLAN adapters for best results.Even thought my ISP cable modem is still as slow as ever, youtube video streaming over the gigabyte wired LAN is very much improved over my old fast Ethernet router.I guess the thing is, this router is for someone who knows more than the average person does about networks. Be versed in all the Wi-Fi standards, IT jargon and TLAs. You must like tweeking settings and getting the max performance from your hardware. Sound like you? Then you will love this router.#### Update #### 8/6/2011I wanted to say that this appliance has really been a pleasent surprise. Other then having trouble with my WD My Book external HD, I have only praise for it.Update about my experience with the Wireless N 5GHz network.I found a cheap Cisco Dual N band Wifi pcmcia card on Amazon. I know it is obsolete, but I have a laptop with nothing to go in this slot and with only 4 usb ports, this was a good choice. The card is great, with only my laptop using the 5Gh band, the connection shows up as 270.0 mbps. I did a few tweeks, but I don't think they made any difference. It is SO VERY FAST!!! For WiFi, I am not even going to bother trying to squeeze any more throughput from it.And, the card can connect to both N Bands, but I am only connected to the High Band, in AP isolated mode. I would never have guessed it would work so well at over 15 feet away in a different room with the door closed. Still an excellent signal.Now for my experience using the File Server feature with a Western Digital My Book Studio 1.5TB.In case anyone else has done this, or is considering hooking up a large capacity storage device to the USB port, here is my experience.I hooked up the above mentioned drive, 1.5 tb in two partitions, to the USB port and used the asus router's http console to share it.The first thing I noticed was that the second partition was back to the old apple partition, which I had deleted when I repartitioned the drive. Other strange things started happening, I stopped using the drive with the router.When I hooked it up to my PC I found the entire drive was set to Read Only and no partitons were visible. I had to remount it with the router and copy all my files to a different drive. Then I used the esata port to get write access and used the windows drive manager to delete the partitions and start over fresh. The drive seems to be none worse for the experience.I don't really know what caused this. It could have been the WD drive is not supported on Linux like a normal USB thumb drive. Just wanted to share my story.Also, if anyone has tried to configure the router for Port Forwarding, and couldn't find it in the Admin HTTP console, you'll have to use the Windows 7 interface on the router's network object. Look for something similar on Vista. For XP, I can't find it.On Windows 7, Open My Computer, in the navigation pane on the left, scroll down to Network and click on it. You should see an icon for ASUS Wireless Router in the right hand panel. Don't x2 Click on it! Right Click on the router object and choose Properties. On General Tab, click Settings button. This is the Port Forwarding interface for the Router. This was my own happy discovery after I needed to set up WHS 2011 on this network.",2,2,0.012244395,0.0651069,0.92264867

"The final flexibility I needed in my wireless network was to free me from the constraints of printer placement.  I could share a printer with other users in the house by simply adding a wireless printer server.  And there it was, the Linksys WPS11.Small and light, connection is a snap.  Disconnect your printer's parallel cable  from its current host and connect it to the printer server.  Connect the power cable from the adapter.  Hook up an Ethernet cable to effect setup.  Put in the CD-ROM, follow instructions, ditch the Ethernet cable, and go wireless.  Right?Well, not quite.  The manual doesn't deal with a lot of issues.  Being an &quot;old hand&quot; (or so I thought) to home wireless networking, I figured that the best bet was to go straight to the Linksys support number.  I did, and three hours (yes, that's right) later, I was off the phone, with everything finally functioning.  And I learned a lot.  Virtually none of the steps we went through appeared in the manual.  Nowhere is it written that you have to install the printer as a local device on every computer from which you want to access the printer.  Knowing a fact like that is kind of important.The time spent in setup aside, I have to give high marks, in general, to Linksys support.  I've talked to maybe 15 differnet folks there over the last year and a half, and, with one exception, all have been polite and knowledgeable.  It has to be a tough job stepping legions of numnutz like me through problems that could be avoided by a better constructed manual.  Anyway, enough.In my experience, wireless networking takes patience.  Generally, once configured, my components (Linksys wireless router with 4-port switch, Linksys wireless printer server, and four or five wireless adapters and PC cards) communiccate flawlessly.  The ability to move components about wihout concern regarding placement or the decor factor of cabling is very freeing.To those contemplating wireless networking for themselves, one comment.  There is a value to a single-vendor network, and htat is you can get all your problems addressed by the vendor's help line.  A multi-vendor network runs you the risk of someone at the other end of the line saying to you (at a critical time), &quot;Sorry, that's not our fault.&quot;  Believe me, that won't help you.",2,2,0.015378474,0.037045214,0.94757634

"This mount is well built and I would have no worries about my TV coming off. The range of movement is excellent and the depth when fully retracted is pretty good. I bought it to mount my 55"" LG LED panel and it fit the TV just fine.However, I returned the mount due to it not working for my particular application. Basically, the wallplate part is too short. It fits 16"" on center studs just fine but has very little extra width. That means the studs have to be well centered on the wall if you want the TV perfectly centered. In my case, they are off by about 3 inches. I ended up going with a tilting-only mount that had a 22"" wallplate which I can mount centered on the wall but with the lag screws slightly off-center.Edit (Dec 30, 2013):I've changed my review above to a 5 star from 3 originally. Shortly after I wrote the above, a rep from the company responded in comments to ask if there was any way to resolve my issue with the unit. As I had already returned it and had been refunded, there was nothing further I needed.

"I had a PSW-140 (over 10 years old) that finally died. I think it was from a power surge. Sent the amp section back to Polk for repair. Because parts are no longer available, they could not fix it. However, Polk did something that has made me a life-long customer. They offered me a deal on any current-model Polk subwoofer of my choosing, since I went to the trouble to send in the old amp for repair. I picked the 125 and I'm very happy with it. From start to finish, I dealt directly with a manager at Polk who was very helpful, informative and a really nice guy to boot. You can tell he loves his work. And the deal he gave me on the new unit was unbelievable - I can't thank Polk enough. I'm not going to publish the price for the replacement because I don't think it's fair to Polk. This was an unusual situation, and they did an unusually nice thing for a long-time customer. This is a company I like dealing with.

"It's easy to forget that just a few years ago, a radio that has access to thousands of worlwide radio stations and also possessing the unique musical genome capabilities of a free service like Pandora would have cost at least hundreds of dollars, not even taking into account the small footprint, digital technology, and wireless capabilities of this radio.  That's why it gets 5 stars.  It is simply a marvel of simplicity and functionality, and allows us to listen to new music every day, exposing us to songs that we might never have heard.  It took us about 20 minutes from unpacking it to get it up and running, though it is a multi-step process that involves registering the radio with Livio and with Pandora over the computer.  One note, have your WEP security code for your wireless network and the radio serial number handy to successfully achieve the registration and the wireless activation.  We have the radio in the kitchen, and there are no lags or noticeable interruptions with the flow of music, the buffering capability of the radio seems to work flawlessly.  We have moved the radio around our multi-level house with no signal strength degradation, the wireless scanning ability of this radio is superb.  Don't expect audiophile audio performance, but it does have a ported enclosure and is a decent radio in terms of sound quality for the price.  More important is that the speaker at higher volumes does not rattle and vibrate, a dead giveaway of cutting corners through the use of cheap parts.  It can be easily hooked up with a L-R RCA cable (not provided) to your home system with the radio audio out jack and included adapter if you want to add internet radio capability to your higher-end system.  Once we achieved the simple activation, heard the music, and noted the capabilities of this radio, this is an easy 5-star recommendation once we paused and thought of how much performance we bought for so little money.",2,2,0.00062978535,0.0028300327,0.9965403

"I am always on the lookout for an easy way to expand my home network. The easiest, having the entire house wired for Ethernet, is alas, not available. The simplest way to add on nodes is via a simple Ethernet extender, such asMonster Cable 121668-00 Ethernet Switch (DLES5). I have used two of these in my office/media room. Setup was a snap, and everything worked easily.But what about the rest of the house. You want to extend WiFi into all the nooks and crannies where the signal disappears. There are two ways to go: A WiFi extender, such asLinksys RE1000 Wireless-N Range Extender. This works well, provided you can get some signal to extend. Be prepared, though, to spend some time setting it up.Another option is a Powerline network extender. This uses your existing electric network to distribute the signal. I hoped to be able to get a better connection using this device.Setup was not a breeze, despite the claim that the device was ""plug and play."" I suspect that everything would have been simple if I had a simpler network to expand. Unfortunately, my first attempt hit a major snag. I was able to connect to the network, but not to the Internet. This is when I had a nice surprise. I logged onto the web site for TP-Link and found a FAQ in the support section. Unlike many FAQs, this one addressed the questions likely when installing the product, including ""What can I do if I can't have Internet connection after connected to powerline adapter?"" Wow! First, the answer walked thru the installation process to make sure that wasn't the problem. I carefully repeated the steps in the right order. Then I came to the crucial element: naming the network the same as the one you are already using. Voila! There was the internet.Now, I have a much faster link in my kitchen, where I seem to spend more time than the office. Kudos to whoever wrote the FAQ answers.After this experience, I elevated my rating to a full 5-stars.

"I've seen Hoodmans mentioned for years. I've always passed on them because of the terribly high price they sell at (and never go on sale).I recently had a chance to try them at a photo expo and was sold on it right then - this makes viewing your LCD in the daylight incredibly easy. I found the most benefit from older cameras (like a canon XTi or 40D) - the newer ones like the T2i have a much brighter screen that is easier to see in sunlight (although the hoodman does make a noticeable improvement to those as well).The usage is pretty straight-forward (just look at the product image!) and comes in a couple different sizes (I believe 2"", 3"" and 4""). I bought the 3"" even though I have 2"" LCD's (XTi/40D) - I didn't notice any problems with hitting buttons.The eyepiece rotates left/right which acts as a diopter so you can see clearly. The eyepiece also pops off (although it's a bit scary the first time as it is held in place by a sticky-material) and can be replaced with a3x Magnifying Eyecup for HoodLoupe 3.0- I found this replacement piece to be much easier to use, but it costs half the price of the already-expensive Hoodloupe (the product you're looking at now). The eyepiece helps a lot for those with glasses as it blocks off external light from entering.The other use for this is with Liveview and recording video on DSLR's - since all video is seen through the LCD, this lets you see it CLEARLY when used outdoors or in bright areas. The downside are the way you connect it - either with a 20-dollar rubber band they sell, or aHoodman HCRN HoodCrane for HoodLoupe 3.0(which is 90 bucks). As you can see, this quickly adds up and you'll be spending well over 200 bucks by the time you're done.Does it work? Definitely! I love it! Is it worth that much money? If you can afford it or need it.The Loupe also comes with a little zippered-bag to carry it, and a neckstrap to keep it on you.For video on a DSLR, I actually keep it around my neck (on the strap) and place it up to the DSLR's screen.. if you use the eyepiece (linked above) you can actually just hold your eye up to it and keep it in place, avoiding the Hoodcrane or rubber-band options.. it actually works very well and the benefit is that it moves out of the way once you take the came away from your face.The bag is nice as it will keep finger prints off (but doesn't quite fit with the bigger eyecup, linked above). The neckstrap is also nice, but definitely has a ""nerdy"" look to it when walking around in public (if that matters to you). The other thing is that this is a fairly hard piece, and can't squish down.. carrying it in a bag will take up valuable realestate.",2,2,0.0015050119,0.0039306753,0.9945643

"Got mine for >$100 at another vendor on sale; great for that price. Yet, there are problems. No vesa mounts. If you try to used it as a TV as well as your monitor, whenever your screen saver kicks in the screen automatically searches, and finds your TV set top box default screen instead of your computer output. Then you have to go through the menu to find your computer output screen again, and this will happen over and over again. Or, once the monitor decides it has 'no video input', you're screwed; you can't access the menu to change it to the connection that actually DOES  have a signal. Another screw up.  I'm sure it works great for idiots, but I would like the option of keeping whatever input I want to stay there.

There is slight clamping pressure at first, but after some usage this evens out and sits snugly on my head without being reminded of them actually being there.  Made from high quality parts/material and most certainly feels as sturdy as it looks, just need to be careful with the grilles when handling.Having owned a decent multitude of headphones, with the closest competitor being the HD650, these are absolutely the best sounding and most dynamic of them all. Mids are amazing, highs are fairly close to perfect, and the lows, much to my surprise are perfect. Not a basshead headphone, surely, but the HD700s have the most phenomenal presentation of bass I have ever heard. So much detail and so crisp. Never boomy, always just right.One thing to consider when deciding to purchase these is that a decent amp is needed to give them enough juice to sound as they should. They're rated at a 150ohms, not as power-hungry as the HD800, HD650, or even the HD600s, but definitely requires a good amp. Not as amp-picky as other headphones, but a right match would make this perfect, which is my current pursuit. I currently used a Fiio E12, which has plenty of juice to make them sing, but a proper tube  / hybrid amp or a higher quality solid state is stronly recommended. They sound pretty good out of DAC from my MacBook Pro Retina, but I have tried the Explorer from Meridian, and it does clean up the sound a bit and allows for higher quality recordings up to 24/192. It also has a built-in headphone amp, which sounds decent with the HD700s, but when I couple the  E12 with the Explorer, it is just so much better. A great &#34;budget&#34; combo with amazing synergy. I will be investing in a better DAC and amp in the very near future.At first, I cannot deny that I was somewhat skeptical of these, especially from large amount of confusing and mixed reviews. For once, I am glad I took a chance. Best purchase I've made in the last 5 years.If you got the bucks, then don't think twice. If you don't, I would seriously suggest on saving up for these starting...... tomorrow.",2,2,0.00030415016,0.0010803936,0.9986154

"It was a perfect pairing - I needed a webcam to function as a security camera.  There are plenty of offerings out there but the key points I wanted:  night vision capability (IR lights), wireless connection, and the big one - true pan and tilt operation.This Dlink unit fulfills it all.Now the big question:  Is it any good?Image quality wise, it's excellent in the daytime with crisp images.  Night time quality fades quite rapidly with a lot of noise, indicative of a cheaper sensor being placed into the unit.  Caps out at 640x480 so you know the sensor is indeed not anywhere near HD quality and probably rates at 480 lines on a traditional analog scale.  That's good quality for close-up stuff and perfectly suited indoors, but this wouldn't make a good outdoor camera where you need longer distance shots to make things out.I do not use the mydlink feature as I find it a bit scary to use a 3rd party website that could monitor me.  Instead, I simply have Ipcamview on my android camera.  It's so easy to setup and I can pan and tilt too, from my android Galaxy Note 2 phone.  I love it.Setup of the camera is easy if you have even basic networking knowledge.  Key points is to make sure the default port is other than 80 as most internet providers block that port, and to open up the forwarding on your router.  I've been doing this for years so it's second nature to me.  I'll have to say the software setup does explain this all though and does it quite well so anyone with half a brain should be able to setup for remote viewing even if you haven't done it before.Night vision is decent.  It really helps to have some kind of ambient light which most people are going to have indoors anyways (it's good to light up the house when you're gone).  But like I mentioned, there is a lot of noise in the images.Security wise, there are options for emailing you based upon motion detection. I haven't tried this feature yet but amazing it's even available.  Like any security camera, setting up motion detection properly takes quite a bit of fine tuning to eliminate false positives and that's an issue no matter what kind of camera setup you have.Pan and tilt work quickly without much noise.  One thing that does make audible noise is the camera switching to night vision mode (B&W;) when the light drops.  It makes a click that you can hear - could be an issue if you have the camera mounted where you sit a lot.Overall, the value here is pretty good.  Granted, it's not an HD quality image but you aren't paying for that.  You're instead paying for true IP operation with a wireless connection and the pan/tilt motor.  Don't hesitate to buy this if you need a setup to remotely view your home's interior when you're away.",2,2,0.017505929,0.17161025,0.8108838
"I originally purchased a Xincom 503 Dual WAN router and wasted many many hours with its firmnware and configuration bugs - it never worked well. Eventually (months later) I gave up on waiting for Xincom bugs to be fixed and purchased this LinkSys RV082. Setup was simple and straight forward and it worked reliably since day 1. It came with the latest firmware loaded.I'm using this router to load balance my cable and DSL broadband connections. I haven't tried and am unlikely to need the VPN features of the RV082. I do use it to host various mail and web servers and the port forwarding features and 1-to-1 maps of static WAN IP's to local IP's work very well.I wish the DMZ was shared with a LAN port rather than the second WAN (you can't have both at once, so the choice is single WAN + DMZ or DUAL WAN and no DMZ).The unit has a quality look and feel which is also reflected in its solid performance. Recommended without hesitation.Update Oct 2006:The router fault light came on after months of reliable operation and the unit would no longer work. Linksys did a cross-shipment with a brand new replacement (since it was within the warranty period).I remain very happy with the router and would definately buy again despite needing a replacement. LinkSys cross-shipment worked well and the replacement arrived in about two ot three days.",2,2,0.0015095557,0.003876152,0.9946142

"Caution:  I suspect that many reviewers in fact purchased a different product, and their complaints refer to other brands and other models of Y-cables.The Cables-to-Go brand model 28107 Y-cable works well for the purpose, the quality is good, and the USB connectors fit well.As described, the cable is about 6' long---but that isn't as long as it sounds---measure how much cable you'll need before buying one.  5' to 6' is ideal for me.  But since the whole point is maximum power, you want to keep the cables as short as possible.  3' Y-cables are available, and would be preferred, if you can use such a short cable--for example with a portable computer.  Try not to use extension USB cables or adapters with a Y-cable---there will be a little loss of power with each connector.The long arm (with the mini-B connector which plugs into your hard drive, or DVD drive, or scanner) is almost 5 feet long.  Each of the short arms are about 1 foot long, for a total spread of up to 2 feet and so, should reach USB ports even on the opposite sides of some portable computers.  Of the short arms, one is red and labeled ""power only""; the black one is power and data.  For most users, it doesn't matter which USB plug plugs into which of your computer's USB ports, as long as both  are plugged DIRECTLY into your computer's ports.  If you happen to have both fast and slow ports---use the black plug in a fast port.Since the whole point of using a Y-cable is maximum power, avoid using spitters with Y-cables.  If your computer has only two USB ports, it would be okay to use a splitter for a USB mouse (or other data only or low power device) and the red plug of the Y-cable.  If you need more full-power ports, a powered splitter (that has its own little transformer which plugs into an AC outlet) may be a solution.  Even so, try to always plug the black plug directly into one of your computer's USB ports.",2,2,0.017786669,0.1648632,0.8173501

"The complaints about the battery location: I dropped a portable CD unit in the past that had its battery compartment on the outside and ruined it because the frail battery hinge and catch broke.There is no provision for an external AC or car power adaptor. And I found battery life somewhat less than on the many Sony units I have owned. If you listen a lot where an external power source is convient, you may end up losing the money you saved on the otherwise good valued player.For ""free"" headphones, I actually found these better than the bundled headsets I've gotten with the many of these little players I've gone through, and far superior to any ear buds I've tried. The five foot cord is both longer and stronger than the little strings that tie most cheap headphones. You'll need to use the first ""XBS"" bass boost setting on the player. They sound best if moved slightly forward from the natural feeling spot centered on the ears. But for serious listening, get a pair of Grado T60s or Sennheiser PX100s.The display will not show remaining time on the CD, a feature I've grown accustomed to on my Sony units.While the unit does not LOOK durable, I've subjected mine to a lot of bumps, drops, and other gardening indignities with no failure so far.

"This adapter works as advertised, just plug and go.  I made the mistake of buying the non-active one at first, so it obviously didn't work.The image on this is perfect, and the image on the monitor I have plugged into it (a 19&#34; Dell) looks just like my other two monitors that are plugged in via DVI (two 22&#34; Dells), so that's great.  The colors do seem a bit more vivid on the 19&#34; monitor, so if you're doing any photoshop work, you'll probably need to calibrate it, although that could be due to the different monitor types.  I haven't done any gaming on the 19&#34; monitor, so I can't comment on its refresh rate compared to DVI.For extra screen space for studying or office work, this thing does the job well.

So, combined the Samsung MTD5120 mSATA drive from provantage with a mSATA USB3 caseMyDigitalSSD Bullet Proof USB 3.0 mSATA SSD Enclosure Adapter - MDMS-BP-USB3, connected through the best USB3 Express card adapter I've found to date, theTranscend USB 3.0 Express Card Adapter for Laptop TS-PNU3.  Total cost was about four hundred fifty, so about 65% of the Kingston HyperX.  Speed is good, size is small, but downside is having to have a USB3 power cable and adapter to use it.  Net, for price I'm glad I got it, but given the need to have the USB3 parts all the time, I'll use this new mSATA setup in something a bit less critical with less frequent use, i.e., as a mobile backup for the MyDocs folder on my laptop when traveling.Have posted the Crystal Diskmark results for the mSATA drive below, connected via USB 3 to the same laptop as my HyperX, so therefore, should be pretty comparable results.

I've been an Adobe Creative Suite user for years and went to school to learn them. And I've also been burned by the change to Adobe Cloud - where you pay for the license monthly - and am not happy with it. I've tried some other open source options like Inkscape and liked them but nothing comes close to Illustrator for options available. This version of CorelDraw is the first time I've seen a legit contender. If you are looking for a vector based drawing program there is a lot to like here.I love that you buy it once. I love that it isn't $1000 like some of the stand alone Adobe offerings. I really like that it works well as a legit alternative.It has a proprietary extension that very few other software companies recognize or work with. You can import and open most Adobe files. Not so with Corel. You have to own the program to open. Years from now I'll still be able to open old Photoshop files (as I frequently do) in several different programs as needed. But I don't know if I'll ever be able to open any of the Corel files.I like this program. If I weren't still actively using Illustrator CS7 and was looking for a new alternative to Cloud I'd seriously consider this. But once I did go with this I'd pretty much have to stick with this forever if I want to open old files.,2,2,0.003091142,0.010868427,0.9860405

"It is actually more camera than I really need.  16 mega-pixels is overkill for me, but nice to have for cropping or for the occasional large print.  This camera fits my hands nicely.  I recently updated the firmware to 2.1, and the auto iso is much improved.  The lenses I have for it are the XC 16-50, the XF 27mm, and two Russian Industar lenses mounted with adapters.  I think the X-E1 strikes a nice balance of modern and traditional elements of photography.  I think that unless you absolutely have to have the fastest, the latest and the greatest, you might save your money and buy the X-E1 instead of the new X-E2.  Keep the money in your pocket, or buy a new lens.Criticisms- Fuji's fit and finish, while very nice in general, occasionally is lacking...for instance the seam that runs along the bottom of the X-E1, separating front from back; a very poor fit, making the camera look flimsy and cheap when it really isn't. Also, the metal on the top does not feel as solid as it does on the X10 or XPRO1 but it is still very nice.  These things really don't bother me at all after owning the camera for some time, just something that you might notice at first. (apparently this is a quality control issue, as I purchased a second X-E1 and it does not have the seam problem.)And the black rubber around the EVF does not do a very good job of excluding extraneous light, and there is no means of attaching a more effective eye cup.I found out quickly that the finish rubs off quite easily.

"Bought for my Kindle Keyboard and it fits perfectly. The main benefits of this case are the fact that it zippers completely closed and that it is a rigid exterior instead of a soft case with only padding. There are not many choices of cases with both features, and this one is the best of the lot. It is not as hard as I had expected, flexing in the center more than I hoped it would. I took one star away for that because the biggest danger for Kindle's (besides being dropped) is pressure on the screen making a very hard cover a good investment. Still, this is well made and barring a direct blow or something pointedly pressing on the middle over the screen it should provide adequate protection.The straps on mine hold the Kindle very firmly, but the nice fit also means you can't charge it while it is in the case. Time will tell if the straps wear out from taking it out and putting it back in for charging. The mesh pocket is useless because its not very big and anything you put in it will be pressed against the aforementioned overly sensitive to damage Kindle screen. I think I'm just going to cut the pocket out of mine entirely so I will have the soft lining down the entire front face of the Kindle.

Keep in mind, these Infinities are running off a factory headunit,no amp- while my Polks are running off a higher end Pioneer HU with EQs, and amp. Im not knocking the Polks, they are a very good entry level speaker. But I am really much more impressed with the Infinities sound imaging!These were mounted in factory locations low in the doors and the sound imaging of these are way better than my Polks. It sounds like they are set at ear level and not low in the doors at all.Only issue was these wont fit in factory locations in an '02 Saturn L300. *You will need to add at least a half inch spacer and drill new holes in the inner door panels for the front speakers.

Rear speakers however just needed new holes drilled(no biggie), but no spacers.Good speakers, and at less than $50 on Amazon(compared to $70-$100+ elsewhere)...its pretty much a no brainer.I'll be replacing my Polk DXI's, with these 6032CF's for sure!",2,2,0.00044610642,0.0015194241,0.9980344

"Upgraded from the DB6501 to these. The difference is overwhelming! I did a weeks of researching speakers before making my final upgrade decision. Had listened to some Focal F series, was considering Hertz and Rainbow. Almost splurged on some McIntosh Speakers.But for $200 these MM6501 are a steal!! They easily rival the Focal F for clarity and sweet mid bass. Even deep bass comes out clean and powerful and sound great, even without a sub.I'm driving mine with an old Rockford 451s Amp that powered them at roughly 183w RMS x2.be mindful, these are 2.7ohm speakers.",2,2,0.0005933135,0.0014569074,0.9979498
"I boughtLogitech Trackman Marble Mousea few weeks back and was dissatisfied with the lack of a scroll wheel.  I bought the Shuttle Xpress primarily to function as a scroll wheel for typical use.  I started using it to the left of my keyboard so I could use my right hand on the mouse.  So far I couldn't be happier with it.For many applications I use it simply as a scroll wheel, much like a typical mouse has, with the Jog being line-by-line scroll and the shuttle being fast scroll.  At first I was afraid that using two hands instead of one for simple navigation would pose a problem, but the opposite has turned out to be true.  By binding several of the most common keyboard tasks to the shuttle Xpress, navigation is actually faster.The software is pretty robust.  The shuttle dial has 7 increments in both directions.  Each of these increments can be programmed much like a button.  The Jog dial is essentially the same as a scroll wheel on a mouse.  There are 5 buttons, each can be assigned as a modifier key (control, shift, etc.), a combination of keys, or a special function and this action can be repeated at specified intervals.  This isn't as flexible as some macro key pads are, which often allow for timed key combinations, but it's plenty for typical applications.For specific applications the shuttle Xpress is extremely convenient.  I do a lot of simple video editing and video analysis, and being able to efficiently navigate frame-by-frame, fast forward, and rewind is amazing.  Having a jog & shuttle dial is a huge improvement over the mouse and keyboard setup I normally use.  It is great for recreational playback of video as well.  I haven't gotten the chance yet to test it in all of my computer tasks, but when I do I will update my review.I think you could make this device useful for nearly any task, the problem is that it requires some creativity on the part of the user to decide what the bindings should be.  Basically, don't expect this to be a install-and-done sort of device, it will take some tweaking.",2,2,0.0034742316,0.010629693,0.98589605

"WOW.  This player simply handles music superbly well and just ROCKS!!!  Before getting this player, I originally was going to get either the iPod Touch or the Samsung YP-P2, from my dying 4G iPod and insufficient 1G 1GB Nano.  The touch interfaces are pretty cool, but eventually thought that they were ultimately a gimmick and also provided no tactile controls.  Plus, excellent sound quality is a top priority for me, and then cost.  Before I made up my mind to spring for the YP-P2 for it's above average sound quality versus the Touch on Amazon, I came across the Sony Walkman NWZ-A818 which won a CNET Editor's Choice for it's excellent sound quality and bundles of features.After reading CNET's review, I became a member of AtracLife forums and read almost all of the reviews for this player.  Sony has always made quality players with superb sound quality, but software packaging always marred the overall user experience and package.  However, I learned that this Sony, the NWZ-A818, no longer supports the notoriously horrid SonicStage and thus the ATRAC format. Rather, the player supports Drag & Drop and MPT, which users will be able to sync and use the player with Windows Media Player, and music formats of WMA, ACC, MP3, and WAV.I have always been a fan of iTunes and it's excellent integration with iPods.  Before the iPod, I had a Rio Karma, which I still miss today because of it's excellent sound quality.  After the Karma came the 4G iPod, and then the 1G iPod nano.  I have always thought the iPod's sound quality lacked something, a particular enveloping warm sound and low levels of bass. (I highly disregard the iPod's EQ, but bass reproduction is certainly biased with ok to good sound with the use of Sony's MDR-EX51 or Vmoda bass freq, or so I thought until I got the Sony A818)Then came this Sony NWZ-A818.  I simply cannot emphasize how excellent the sound quality of this player is, so I'm certainly not biased in anyway in giving high praises for this Sony Walkman.  I listen to a variety of music genres, but my love is for EDM genres such as trance, dance, or drum & bass.  Sound quality is of a high caliber on the flat settings.  I'm listing to the player as of writing this review.  I have the volume on a relatively low level, at 10/30, and the sound is very well balanced.  The treble and bass are very well defined and correlate together perfectly in harmony.  And then there are the multiple options of boosting the sound even further with two custom equalizers (5-band parameter settings) along with other presets and other 'surround sound' (most noteable is the Matrix setting).  Not to mention that it comes with Clear Stereo, proprietary DSEE (sound enhancer for high bitrate files), and dynamic normalizer, which all work well. As a bonus, Sony included $70 MDR-082 earbuds, which are one of the best balanced earbuds I have owned.  The player above all simply works great right out of the box, with no hassle of purchasing better earbuds.Many user reviews for the sound quality of the NWZ-A818 are certainly not kidding (such as the excellent reviews from ""S. Su"" or ""Wookalia 'Wookalia'"").  It really doesn't surprise me since Sony and sound quality really come hand in hand since they have nearly 2 decades of sound expertise from their original Walkman.  You will really appreciate the sound quality of this player, especially coming from the iPod line. Sound is crisp, warm, and enveloping, which is just simply bliss. Classical music sounds clear, so well defined that you can hear all the ranges.  Enya never sounded better.  Sound reproduction of her work is so good that she seems to be literally standing in front of you and you can visualize the movement of lips singing. From what I hear, the treble is very crisp and detailed.  With bass on the flat settings, it is clear and defined.  It doesn't have the low quality muffled sound that degenerates the treble.  I have to be honest and say that I'm a basshead. The ""Clear Bass"" of up to +3 definitely cures any of my cravings for pounding bass, and the name is very appropriate... the bass really is clear and not muffled.  It is deep, defined, and and gives off a very nice punch.  Bass heavy tracks are just simply amazing. Kanye's work is very punchy but not overwhelming so that you can't hear the treble, in another words well balanced and you won't be fatigued with long listening periods of bass intense tracks (on flat settings). Tracks from the more electronic genres such as Tiesto, Trentemoller, Armin, or Diesel boy simply makes my head spin with joy.Apart from sound quality, the excellent user interface is logical and fast to find songs.  A 35 hour battery life is just stunning for such a thin package.  I got a polycarbonate hard clear case for this model and it's still thin at 14mm (which i prefer over the original player of 9mm).  How thin is too thin? Probably when Apple comes out with the iPod Pico, that is literally paper thin and has 1 hour of battery life, considering the rate that each phase of the nano is going haha ;).  Pictures and Videos look excellent, but I rather save the memory for of course music ;).Sony is also coming out with Media Manager for Walkman soon, which is a software that will offer even tighter integration with music files (hopefully gapless) and conversion of various files.  One downer though about this player (at its current firmware) is that it does not support on the fly playlist creation and rating songs.  I am quite sure sony will address this issue with future firmware updates, since the NW-A808 (a European sibling of the NWZ-A818) supported playlist creation and rating of songs on the player.  I can live without these features missing at the moment, since my music library consists of 106 GB and playlists can be transferred quickly from iTunes to Windows Media Player and then synced to the player.All in all, I am extremely happy with the purchase of this player, and quite frankly will probably not go back to the iPod line until Apple does something about it's sound quality (such as a custom EQ), which will probably be never since I have been waiting for that feature since the 4G.  It is VERY VERY ironic since they can create such a fantastic User Interface and OSx on the iPod Touch but not create a much more simpler program such as user defined EQ?  Ultimately, the build quality, sound quality, user interface, and other unique features of this Sony NWZ-A818 most definitely outweigh any of the player's cons. I'm very confident that true music lovers and audiophiles will not be disappointed with this player :D.[EDIT]After owning this player for about a week, it's really amazing what this player can do.  Not to kid, but the player actually has breathed new life in my older songs.  For instance, the bundle of the player and the MDR earbuds enable me to hear subtle background noises with great clarity, such as the ping of a music triangle. Seal's new album ""System"" just sounded wonderful.  I was listening to the player in the library at a low volume of 6/30 and even at this low level, the music is still VERY WELL defined.  I do use the dynamic normalizer on the player and the sound image (at flat settings) is just amazing!  To me all ranges of the treble, mid, and bass are just perfectly balanced.  Or rather, this player really enables you to truly listen to what the artist originally recorded. Perhaps it was the significant upgrade of the MDR-EX51 to the MDX-EX082, as headphones do make a huge difference in sound quality, but i did a sound comparison of my 4G iPod and this Sony.  With the Sony stock earbuds, i hooked it up to the iPod and played ""I can't get no satisfaction"" by the Rolling Stones.  Volume was at 50% and sound definition was good. But lower than 50%, i started to lose the sound definition.  What is interesting though was that the Sony at a volume of 10/30 matches the volume level of the iPod at 50% approximately. Of course the Sony sounded much better, sound was definitely warmer and more defined in all ranges.  Even at a lower volume on the Sony, say 5/30, the sound retained the track's definition but at a lower decibel. I can definitely see why this player got the CNET's Editor's choice, this player really makes me appreciate the artist's work!",2,2,0.004707991,0.006772835,0.98851913

"Compared side-by-side to the UE Boom (which is similar size and price, and which gets rave reviews), the Bose Soundlink Mini Bluetooth speaker sounds much better, has much fuller base while maintaining a nice sizzling treble. On a scale of 1 to 10, if a typical $2000 home stereo with full size speakers rates a 10 in terms of high fidelity sound, the Bose rates a 7 and the UE Boom rates a 3. The UE Boom really has no bass -- at all -- so music is missing a lot of depth. (And yes, I updated the software for the UE Boom and I set the equalizer to &#34;extra bass&#34;, all to no avail.)  Maybe that's OK if all you're interested in is voice or hip hop, but I listen mainly to blues and rock and indie, and I like full spectrum sound.  In terms of volume, both the Bose and the UE Boom provide enough volume to easily fill up a ordinary bedroom or living room, but don't expect either of them to provide overpowering music for a party of 100 people. Bose has really done a good job designing this product. Controls are easy to use and nicely responsive.Of course, the UE Boom provides some additional features, such as speakerphone, which the Bose lacks.  And the Boom is very rugged.  You can throw it onto a back seat or into a backpack without fear.

"When I first seen this tablet on Amazon I had thought to myself ""the specs on this tablet are awful, it's going to be rubbish.."" So I figured I'd buy it and give it a try anyways; I'm a big fan of lenovo and have their yoga laptop and really enjoy it. So after I got it I realized how much easier its to use the tablet with most of its weight in the large grooved part at the bottom. It was awkward at first, then once I realized how easy its to use single handed and having a stand built in was a definite plus as well. After that I started to toy around and get my usual apps downloaded from the playstore. I had expected horrible lag, especially considering that there is only 1 GB of ram on it. I have only noticed lag one time over the past couple days of use and that was when I had 8 apps running in the background. Otherwise ,it handled like a dream. The screen is clear and crisp,and even on the brightest setting and really using the tablet ""internet over WiFi all day, running tons of apps, customizing, playing games, etc"" the battery life is phenomenal. Finally a tablet that can last me almost all day without fear of finding an outlet!The sounds seems to be very crisp and clear with Dolby speakers and a built in app to handle audio.Now this tablet isn't perfect, there are some things that annoy me about it. One is the lackluster rear facing camera, sitting at 5 mp its seriously lacking. Another issue is that there is no flash.. Almost takes away the whole point of having a camera installed.. Images are OK as long as the subject is well lit, otherwise just use your phone instead. Another issue is that while the stand is nice, it tends to stick and be hard to adjust, I'm assuming so the the screen can stay in position and you can still tap on it without it closing. I almost dropped in on a couple different occasions trying to fold it out. The trick I found is that you don't pull from the back but instead turn from the bottom where you hold it. Helps loads but still kind of stiff. Another issue is the lack of a Sim port for cell data. Sure you can get around that issue by tethering your phone and upgrading your data plan, or finding a WiFi source, but at this price point these issues should have been addressed. The plus side of the negatives? The battery life.So in short, if you want a tablet for all day battery life to school, work or general use the this is a must have. If you are expecting a Razer tablet or high def camera abilities or extravagances look elsewhere. All in all a great little tablet.",2,1,0.102977,0.47876674,0.41825628

"I was hesitent in ording this lighted cover, due to the number of people who had negative comments about it.  After weighing out all of the pros and possible cons, I decided to get it to replace the original non-lighted leather cover I had bought (which I also liked very much, except for the fact that it did not have a light).Overall, I really like it!  And, to my surprise, most of the negative things I was concerned about turned out not to be a problem.I find that the light is excellent.  Amazon appears to have taken a lot of time in designing the LED.  The angle and the way that the light is defused is very nice.  True, it is brighter at the top than the bottom, but I don't think there's much that can be done about that.  I'm not overly concerned about the light breaking off, as I'm not planning on throwing my Kindle around while it's extended.  It turns on/off easily and works with no problems.I love how sleek and thin this case makes my Kindle.  The previous cover was much thicker and buikier.  This one becomes one with the Kindle and the design is great.The front cover is thin, but ridgid.  It reminds me of my 1st gen iPad cover, which has a similar design.  The cover folds back flat for reading and after reading for several hours, I was able to close the cover with no problems, and it stayed closed (without a closure, just like my iPad cover does.)I agree with those who say that the sound gets a bit muffled, since the speakers are covered and are located on the back of the Kindle.  They should have put little slots in the back cover.  However, I can still hear my book being read with no problem, so it's not a drastic difference.The leather seems ok, but I do see where it will scratch easy and this is my only complaint with it.  I don't mind the slikness or shininess of it, but getting so easily scratched can't be a good thing.All and all I really like the lighted cover and would recommend it.",2,2,0.0007203391,0.004097044,0.9951826

"I purchased this headset to replace the rather chintzy, monaural headset provided in the box with Dragon's Naturally Speaking 8 (Standard.)  I was delighted to discover that, even prior to further 'training' of the software, the voice recognition ratio improved immediately and dramatically.  Unlike the hardware from Nuance (the current makers of Dragon), the Plantronics set is USB2 plug-and-play with XP, requiring no software and it works, just as advertised, right out of the box. Other reviews that have criticized this set because of it's inadequate 'portability' and the feeling that the way it can be folded compromises it's structural integrity, simply have not been my experience.  I must say, though, that it doesn't travel. It sits on a hook next to my PC.Voice recognition is not the perfect (or even improved) solution to every writing need - however, coupled with a GOOD headset/microphone combination, it is well worth having and using for many usual Word and emailing functions",2,2,0.008520955,0.013393147,0.97808594

"With 126 LED's, there is more than enough light if you are using any modern camcorder.  While the light does fall of a bit in the corners, it is diffused enough so it is not objectionable or highly noticeable.The color balance is daylight 5600K.  It comes with three diffusion filters  - one white, one light pink and one yellow along with a handy wallet to store them.  The yellow filter is too yellow to match tungsten 3200K, but that's my only gripe here.The unit can be powered by one of three sources - Sony or Panasonic camcorder batteries, or by 6 regular AA cells.  You can keep camcorder batteries charged and ready for use so you don't have to go through AA cells all the time.  A charge provides several hours of light, and the variable dimmer extends that even more.  Rarely will you need full output.There has been some written on the mount being flimsy, but I don't find it to be so bad that it's in any danger of breaking from normal handling.  While it could have been built stronger, keep in mind this is a 35 dollar light. LED's are LED's, and this performs as well as any hundred dollar unit.  Treat it with respect and it'll last a long time.  But even if you break the mount, it unscrews and can be easily replaced in three minutes.",2,2,0.0011651998,0.005913951,0.9929208

"Unfortunately for this mouse's rating I already have a Microsoft 5000 Bluetooth mouse.  I've been using it for about a year now with my Samsung Netbook (built-in Bluetooth) as has my wife.  We both really like the 5000 (with one exception, see below) and this version doesn't make us want to change.This version DOES operate better on a variety of surfaces, but we rarely use any surface other than a mousepad (guess we're old school) and sometimes a table or desk top and the 5000 works fine on those.  This version did work better for us when using the denim covered leg surface.The 5000 is better when it comes to buttons and wheel placement and functioning, the 6000 MIGHT start a bit faster but that's hard to tell for sure.  As some have noted, this model doesn't seem to be as well made as the 5000.Installation/uninstall was easy and quick.  This model has a handy storage location for the mini-dongle in its base and with the dongle is usable in non-bluetooth equiped machines (which is 5 of our 6 units).  This is a very small usb dongle, not the honkin' big thing in the regular sized MS mice (like the one in the 6000 keyboard/mouse bluetooth unit).------Note to MS:  Can't you do something about the model numbering system?  Or give em cute names or something, as it stands no one can tell what is being talked about with just the model number!-----The product literature claims a 10 month battery life - if true, this is one area where it would beat the pants off of the 5000.  The 5000 (which uses 2 AAA's) eats em up in about 3 months unless you turn the mouse off when not in use.  Since batteries tend to fail just when you are the most pressed for time this could be a deal maker.  Just like the way Microsoft seems to always stack up a load of updates for the day I'm running behind, tracking down those elusive replacement batteries can be quite frustrating - and who wants to carry ANOTHER set of replacements?I like the way this unit feels in the hand (I have extra large hands according to glove makers), and for the current price its a pretty good deal for those who need the dongle and a smaller unit for travel.

"Just got this today, will amend review if anything changes.I'm a writer, and a very fast typist. The keyboards is pleasantly clicky, bouncy and responsive, and I can type very fast. It's a ""tactile"" keyboard, and I don't make as many errors as on some of the ""softer"" and ""quieter"" keyboards I've tried.The mouse is surprisingly comfortable for a wireless mouse, decently responsive. I normally HATE wireless mice and use wired mice and wireless keyboards, but I thought I'd give this a try. I've been pleasantly surprised.The reception is fine, but I'm not trying to push the range very far. It's not fussy at all, and my last logitech wireless totally was.Setup was SO painless. Plugged in the dongle, pulled out the tabs for the ALREADY INSTALLED batteries, and boom, it worked.A neat feature... keyboard and mouse BOTH have off switches. This makes sense and should dramatically extend battery life.So far so good!ETA: I've had to for a month or so now, I think, and while the battery life isn't as advertised, that's probably because I don't generally remember to turn the mouse and keyboard off when I'm done using them. Even so, these last about 100 times longer than my previous keyboard and mouse.The mouse is quite responsive. I've disliked wireless mice in the past for being laggy, this one isn't. My scores in Bejeweled Blitz aren't quite as high as they were, but they're still very, very high, and I'm not sure it's the mouse's fault... ;)Typing on the keyboard is great. Every once in a while, it lags, but it seems to buffer what I'm typing, so waiting a moment will get the text to show up. That only happens once every few days, it's not often enough to qualify even as aggravating.ETA: Great keyboard! I didn't realize how great until I accidentally knocked a full glass of liquid into it. There was lemonade running straight through it, across the full width.... I took the batteries out immediately, took out the nine million tiny screws, and opened it up with a plastic knife.... and the electronics were DRY. The top was damp, but no electronics in the upper surface and the panel below is well protected. I dried everything, used a little rubbing alcohol on the keys to get the sticky off (should have just stuck it under running water, the top panel, that is!) let it sit until completely dry, then put it back together... works fine!Six months later: Keyboard is fine. Mouse... OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS MOUSE. Here's the thing... I have kids. And I do my computing from a couch. I drop my mouse All. The. Time. This mouse... it pops apart every time I do... but never, ever breaks, and goes back together just fine. I have another mouse I've owned for less than 2 months that has not held up to the same abuse, and is getting dodgier and dodgier. The battery life on this mouse is outstanding as well.Just a very impressive product all around, and any future keyboard/mice combos I buy will likely be this one, because it just WORKS. I never use the off switches, but still get great battery life, better even than on another ""smart"" mouse I have that turns itself off when the computer is off. We use rechargeables, and I just don't have to swap them very often.18 months of use, and still working great despite a ridiculous amount of abuse from my kids, being dropped off the couch, behind the couch, under the couch, grabbed, drooled on, bitten (I had a baby). We've had a couple keys pop off the keyboard during drops... they snap right back on. Battery compartment pops open when you drop it...but goes back together, no breaking.Final comments: Baby is 16 months old and I'm still using it, but it has seen better days. After being subjected to the abuse of a special needs 8 year old who likes to pick keys off, a toddler who loves to ""type"" but will alternate typing with whacking nearby objects with the keyboard and both keyboard and mouse repeatedly hitting the floor at speed when catapulted from the top of my recliner as I leaped to my feet to deal with my wayward children after putting mouse and keyboard ""out of their reach"", they have suffered the following damages:The control key is nowhere to be found. Just up and disappeared. I'm kind of afraid one of the kids ate it. I can use the control button by sticking my pinky down in the hole but it's definitely time to get a new keyboard. The spring is gone from under the shift key, so it has lost a little zip... but still works.The battery cover finally gave up the ghost, and I ended up using it without the cover most of the time for the past few months.I think someone chewed on the mouse wheel, there is no other explanation for the damage. I ameliorated it with sugru, but one can only do so much.My 16 month old has figured out how to replace the battery, which pops out every time it hits the floor. This happens often enough that if I drop my muose and the battery pops out, he will pick up the mouse, bring it to me, go look for the battery, bring THAT to me, and then put the battery in, and he never gets the orientation wrong. Crazy kid.And with all that?They are still 97% functional as keyboard and mouse. Battery life is still awesome with hybrid rechargeable batteries. The Ctrl button (left side) is annoying as heck because it's the one I use for Ctrl-v etc. But at least it still works! I've had wired and wireless keyboards alike die ignominious deaths (wonder why?) many times before, and holy crap this one is still working. I bought my mother one, I liked it so well.For my netbook I have a similar mouse, but with a pretty red flower on it and a smaller receiver, also Logitech. Love that one too. Baby uses that one all the time and it never even pops the battery. (by use I mean whenever my back is turned he  grabs the netbook and mouse and starts typing vigorously, then uses the mouse, then resumes typing vigorously. One of these days, it will come out Shakespeare.)ETA: I just bought a new one (June 2014) because the ""new and improved"" model I replaced this one with didn't last nearly as long. The edges were more brittle, it started breaking quickly and eventually just flat out refused to turn on. And I'm remembering why I liked the feel of this one so very much. Hopefully we can avoid some of the abuse the last two went through....A note: The keyboard is the K330 and the mouse is a M215, if you're looking for the parts individually.",2,2,0.000547081,0.002012926,0.99744

Almost all the plastic clamps of this type are very cheaply made. Some of the feet have come off but i managed to get them back on. Best thing to do is put a drop of strong glue on the back of the feet right away. It's an issue due to the swivel foot design that can happen no matter what brand you buy. I bought some bigger ones at a local hardware store and one cracked in half after the second use. So for small clamps these are perfect but for larger clamps it's probably best to stick with metal.,2,2,0.012528292,0.2217413,0.7657304
"I already owned the 50mm f1.8 lens when I ordered the new 40mm STM pancake.  Why would I do that?  They're very similar lenses, but the 40mm is a dream come true (if you don't have the money for a more expensive USM lens).Here's why I love the 40mm:1. PRICE:  It didn't cost more than my camera body.  I had saved up $200 already for a lens.  Not a whole lot of money, but it took me a while to come up with money I wouldn't feel guilty spending.2. QUIET FOCUSING:  It's practically silent, so I can be less distracting to other people while I'm getting a shot.  The 50mm F1.8 sounds like a wind-up Hot Wheels car.  You can autofocus quickly during video with the 40mm without hearing it (even without a T4i).3. FOCAL LENGTH:  40mm is a little wider than 50mm, so on APS-C the 50mm feels like a portrait lens and the 40mm feels like a cozy 35mm.4. SHARPNESS:  It's a little bit sharper than the excellent 50mm all the way across the APS-C frame.5. COLOR:  Maybe I'm crazy, but the colors look richer.6. FOCUSING:  Full-time manual focus adjustment.  Once the 50mm F1.8 would lock focus at close range, if I could tell it was off, I would have to either refocus or move the camera.7. SIZE:  Do I need to mention that it's tiny?  I can finally fit my camera into a tiny bag instead of having to fit an oddly shaped tetris-piece camera/lens into a bigger bag.  This means that I can take my camera more places with me because I don't have to take a huge bag.  Smaller lens = more camera.8. BUILD:  The 40mm feels a lot more solid and trustworthy than the 50mm F1.8.9. BOKEH:  Out-of-focus areas are MUCH SMOOTHER than with the 50mm F1.8 (no weird pentagons).Here's why I'm keeping my 50mm F1.8:1. APERTURE:  F1.8.  Sometimes there just isn't enough light and there's nothing you can do about it.  Using wide apertures takes practice though.  (Sidenote: The 50mm F1.8 isn't very sharp wide open until about f2.5, though.)2. 50mm is just a pleasing focal length, especially for portraits on APS-C.Overall, you can't go wrong with the 40mm pancake for $200.  However, for a first prime, I'd recommend getting an F1.8 lens, and the 50mm is the best F1.8 lens for the money.  But if you know you don't need F1.8, just get the 40mm pancake and you'll never look back.  But having both isn't bad, either!",2,2,0.0017456599,0.010001717,0.9882526

"I purchased my first Phantom when they first came out in January.  I had been flying a Hawkspy copter with a low resolution camera for a couple of months and became hooked on aerial photography and the fun of flying.  For less than $100, the Hawkspy was a good value for what you got:Remote control Helicopter with Gyro and Spycamera!! -3.5ch Hawkspy LT-711 BlackA large helicopter capable of filming low resolution video.  The copter flew okay in calm conditions, but any kind of breeze would make flight control difficult, to say the least.  After a few landings in people's backyards, and host of apologies later, I decided to upgrade my equipment to the Phantom and attached a GoPro3 Black edition camera to it's hull.Flight control of the Phantom is vastly superior to the Hawkspy and video resolution of the GoPro is vastly superior to low resolution camera that came with the budget priced helicopter.  For a toy, the Hawkspy is a good value for what it does.  If you want an entry level, professional piece of aerial filming equipment, the Phantom is hard to beat for the price.  My first Phantom cost about $670 and now you can find them for around $470.  A really good deal for a quad copter that is well built, is easy to control, and has GPS.If you read the other reviews, you will find as much technical detail about these quad copters as you want.  I've decided to write this review based upon experience and I have several recommendations:1.  With flying time, screws can become loose.  Check screws on a regular basis to make sure things are tight.  I checked the screws on my second Phantom when it came out of the box and found 3 were loose and needed a little tightening.2.  Get spare props and if you plan on shooting video, get the carbon fiber props and balance them with a prop balancer.  i have a rubber isolated camera mount as well, but I don't think it's necessary for shooting Jello free video.  There is zero jello when shooting 1080/60 with balance carbon fiber props and no rubber isolated camera mounts.  While the isolated camera mount is added insurance, it can cause problems.  On one flight, one of the rubber bushings for the camera mount became detached and when I landed, the GoPro came out of the mount all together resulting in a scratched the lens.  Here is a video I shot with balanced graphite props and no camera isolation mounts.3  Besides paying attention to trees, wind, and wires when flying pay attention to those props when spinning.  I got a pretty good cut when I reached for the Phantom and caught my finger turning blade.4.  When I first got my Phantom, I flew it on a regular basis, weather permitting.  With practice, I became pretty comfortable flying it.  Then I didn't fly it for about two months.  I quickly found I had lost my skills and promptly flew it into a tree.  My first and only crash.  The blades got banged up, but overall, the Phantom came out of the crash in good shape.  If you haven't flown for a while, get yourself familiar with the Phantom in an open area until your skills come back.5.  The prop balancer I use has two powerful magnets to hold the shaft in place.  Keep the prop balancer away from the Phantom.  We recently moved to a new house, so I packed the prop balancer with the Phantom quad copter.  Unfortunately, the magnet was too close to the compass and I had a compass error problem I needed to resolve.  Keep magnets away from the compass unless you want to spend a lot of time getting the compass right again.6.  Get at least two backup batteries.  Ten minutes of flight isn't very long before landing again.  The spare batteries get you back in the air quickly.  I have four batteries and also bring along a portable battery charger if I plan on flying for any length of time.7.  If you are into performance flying, you won't want the added weight of the prop guard.  I'm into filming more than performance flying so I use a prop guard for several reasons.  After cutting my finger, I don't want to cut anybody or anything with those props.  The prop guard helps eliminate this possibility.  The prop guard also makes the Phantom more visible when flying.  I painted the two front prop guards red, so I could more easily tell front from back when the Phantom is flying high in the sky.  Works great.  I also recently added a very bright light over the battery cover.  This combined with the red prop guard make it easy to keep the Phantom oriented the way you want it.8.  Join Phantom Pilots: [...]  It is an online group of folks who fly Phantom Quadcopters.  It's a friendly group and they have good tips for both novice more experienced flyers, alike.9.  Keep a common sense pre-flight check list and go over it before every flight.  Check screws, make sure batteries are charged, check blade tightness, and familiarize yourself with the flight controls making sure you are in GPS mode, if that's how you intend to fly.  Also keep a list of what the meaning of the light signals are, to make sure the CPU, GPS, and compass are working properly.10. If you are filming, bring a back up battery for the GoPro.  The GoPro3 Black edition camera runs down batteries quickly, and I have been stuck with a dead camera and a Phantom ready to fly.Why two Phantoms?  I ended up getting a second Phantom for several reasons.  The price dropped $200 from the time I purchased my first one in January, which helped make my decision.  The main reason I purchased a second Phantom was I have had some down time with my first one.  From updating software issues to compass issues.  I missed several video opportunities because of this down time, so I figured having two would insure at least one Phantom is up and running.",2,2,0.013775553,0.024042238,0.96218216

"When I was in the market for a new TV I knew I wanted a few things... it had to be a 32&#34; Samsung LED with 1080p resolution. I was torn between the UN32EH5000, 5300, and 6300 models. A quick rundown: The 5000 is a 60Hz model without Smart TV, the 5300 adds Smart TV options, and the 6300 introduces a 120Hz refresh rate. Since this would primarily be used for console gaming, the 60Hz would be more than plenty. Also since my Xbox One had all the Smart TV features, the 5300 series would be more expensive.So before buying, ask yourself do you need the 120Hz refresh rate? Do you need Smart TV?

"I built a computer to go in my living room for streaming video/music etc. so it had to be quiet.  My typical mode is to use large fans running slowly to keep the noise down. With the stock AMD cooler on the cpu it was running 112-115 degrees F and i wanted to get it down from that.  I read several reviews of this cooler and decided to give it a try since it has a pretty good size fan. My installation was fast and easy.  This heatsink  took no more than 15 minutes from powering the PC down to restarting it.  The mounting hardware for an AM3+ mobo consists of two small brackets and  two screws.  You simply remove the old cooler, wipe the thermal compound off, loosely screw the brackets to the heatsink and press the new cooler into place.  You do have to unsnap the fan from the heatsink to get to the screws, but this is very easy.The little brackets slip right over the existing heatsink mounting ears and you tighten the screws down to mount it. Put the fan back on, plug the power in and fire it up. The Intel mounts appear to be a little more complex than AMD, but all the parts are included even the thermal compound on the heatsink.  The cooler is very quiet, and has reduced my temps as reported by the mobo sensors to 85-90 degrees F.  (AMD Phenom II 6 core) There are a couple of things I should mention, the cooler has to mount so that it blows either up to the top of the case or down to the bottom on my mobo (Gigabyte GA-78LMT-S2P). I don't know about any other AM3+ motherboards, but this particular one has the  mounting ears top and bottom. This may or may not be a problem to you, but my power supply is at the top of the case and the 120mm fan on the bottom sucks the heat right out the vent on the back of the power supply. Also, I could not find any markings on the fan to show the direction of the air flow, but the fan pushes air over the fins instead of pulling it across the fins. One more thing, this cooler is pretty large, so look at the specs and measure to make sure it will fit your case. All in all a very good cooler at a very good price.",2,2,0.36223546,0.14559472,0.49216986

"This is a great long telephoto lens.  It has great color and contrast.  It focuses as close as 3.5m, and even shooting wide open this lens is extremely sharp.  Really, the only draw back to this lens is that it doesn't have IS.  If you shoot on a tripod, that's not a big deal, and if you have a steady hand, this lens is small enough to handhold and still get sharp pictures.  But especially if you need to shoot in low light, you may want to consider other options.I use my lens mostly for bird photography, and if you have the money, there are good reasons to spend more money on the 400mm f/4 or even the 500mm or 800mm lenses.  With these you can have IS and larger apertures that are highly desirable for bird and action photography.  At the same time, the 400mm f/5.6 is small enough to hand-hold, and it's maneuverable enough to find a moving subject quickly (like a bird in flight) and get the shot.  So, despite the benefits of the larger lenses, this lens has some real advantages at a smaller price tag.You may also want to consider other lenses in this price range, such as the 100-400mm and the 300mm f/4.  Both of these lenses have IS, and they may be as good or better for your needs.  The 100-400mm is great if you need a zoom lens, though it will not be quite as sharp as this lens.  It's also larger and heavier, and the push-pull zoom is a drawback for me.  The 300mm f/4 is a great option if you don't need 400mm, and you can add a 1.4x extender to get to an effective 420mm f/5.6 IS.  However, you again will lose a little image quality by adding the extender.  For my needs, I found it best to get the 400mm f/5.6 and then add a 1.4x or 2x when needed.  For bird photography I don't recommend adding a 1.4x or 2x extender to get to 400mm if you can avoid it.  You want those options to go beyond 400mm for far away birds.",2,2,0.0003579509,0.0019709186,0.99767107

"I've been shooting with a Digital Rebel for about a year, that camera is great but it just plain doesn't have big enough onboard memory buffers for the kind of fast action I tend to shoot. This camera, when coupled with a high speed Compact Flash card will rarely bog down and quit shooting when using continuous mode (5 fps) (even more so if you aren't shooting in full quality mode since more frames fit in the buffers). The difference between this baby and the Rebel is like the difference between a Yugo and a Cadillac, just no comparison!  The Rebel is a starter camera, this is a real camera.  There are three different metering modes, three different types of AF and single and continuous shooting modes available in all ""creative modes"" (i.e. other than the stock modes they give you for common situations and of course in auto mode). I haven't had a chance to shoot a whole lot with the 20D yet but so far I'd say it's much faster (both on startup and between shots) than the Rebel and much more capable in ""mixed-lighting"" situations than the Rebel is. With the rebel, the combination of mercury vapor gymnasium lighting and flash would give my shots these awful yellow backgrounds, so far the 20D is handling this situation in a superior manner--i.e. no annoyingly colored backgrounds (Auto White Balance control is much better here).  If you use IS lenses I suggest you buy the battery grip. The 20D is made of metal and much more ergonomic than the Rebel but someone with big hands will probably still like the battery grip to make the camera easier to hold onto. The built in flash on the 20D is capable but for real shooting you'll want a professional flash. Canon speedlights (550/580EX) are the most integrated but there are other cheaper choices that are just as good (but may not be as integrated).  The 20D has a flash sync port on the side for a ""potato masher"" handle style flash unit such as made by Metz, Sunpak, etc.  This is a pricey camera for most of us but worth the money, I am going to have a lot of fun with this.  One last comment: The 20D apparently incorporates some advanced circuitry that operates with the flash to conserve flash power, it's my impression this is more refined on the 580EX than the 550EX but on my first shoot I did notice far less misfires with the 550EX on this camera than on the Rebel.  If you're torn between jumping on a Rebel or saving for a 20D then save for the 20D it's more than twice the camera the Rebel is and if you shoot fast moving sports you won't be happy with the Rebel Original, the XT is supposedly a bit improved but I still don't believe they've done very much about improving the image buffers and that is where the 20D shines.  Now that I've got my hands on a 20D I'm curious about what the even more expensive Canons can do.",2,2,0.005874687,0.017999284,0.97612596

"I've been running into that good friend of the older-than-40 crowd, presbyopia -- which literally comes from the Greek for &#34;elder eye&#34;. I used to be 20/10 when I was younger, so it is somewhat humbling to watch numbers swim in Excel spreadsheet columns at the end of the day. And my laptop? Fuggetaboutit.I bought a pair of readers with the lightest magnification from a drug store, and while they fix the problem they introduce others: The focal distance seems very fixed, so you end up with blurry vision if you try to focus on anything more than 3 feet away (like the whiteboard on the other side of my office), and they provide no help to peripheral vision. So they worked to magnify text, but everything else sucked.A friend mentioned that I should try these...and I found them to be amazing! The frames are very light and comfortable -- a concern of mine since I can't wear certain types of sport sunglasses (like Oakleys). They sit a good distance from your eyes and wrap around slightly, providing you with good peripheral coverage without being so close that my eyelashes brush against them. The focal distance is nice as well -- you don't have that feeling like it is spotty, and I can look around the office within feeling like I'm going to get a headache. And, after wearing them for a long day, I don't have the same low-grade headaches that I now recognize as being due to eye fatigue.They're not cheap...but they are certainly worth it, even two months later.",2,1,0.19515185,0.49007124,0.3147769
"I bought one of these to watch Netflix on my older (non-HD) television.

(There is no power button.)- The software doesn't have a great deal of options or features. The box itself (without any 'channels') is essentially useless -- it won't do LAN streaming of any kind, for instance.- The Netflix app is uglier and more limited than the one on the Xbox 360, or even (in some ways) the browser-based player. The major limitation for me is that auto-playing TV episodes is not supported. Additionally, there is no overlay information when you're watching something -- if you pause the video, it just pauses the video, that's it.

"* This camcorder is one of the better buys for a cheap DV camcorder that'll give you solid performance and decent quality for the price.  Don't expect it to blow away $800+ 3CCD high-end camcorders, but do expect about 350 lines of resolution under EIA 1956 test pattern tests.* While video quality isn't the very best when viewed on a PC monitor (vs. high-end camcorders), watching the end results on most non-HDTV TV sets give you very good video quality and nice results.* Menuing system and layout works well for me, and no manual needed.  Overall, it's simple enough that my 3 year old niece took it from my hands and filmed her own birthday by herself.  That easy to learn and use!* A few manual controls such as manual iris, gain, white balance make this a nice beginner level videographer's camcorder as well -- ie. good for learning, students.* Stabilization isn't as good as on the more expensive, so tripod or simply hold it steady on wide angle. You can get nice results with the latter.* Still pictures only 640x480 and grainy, but decent just to get a still image idea of what's going on for reference.  Bring a digital camera if you really want good stills.  Otherwise, works well and no real problems.* Build is nice for the price. Solid and nice feel in hands. Comes with everything except a blank tape and perhaps a bag if you want to carry it in something.* Battery lasts 1 1/2 hours or so -- one battery, one tape.  Just buy and carry one battery for every tape you expect to use - easy to remember. Charges in about 2 hrs.* Can't find a single big reason to return it for the price -- just a nicely priced, beginner's DV camcorder that does quite a lot.  A happy little toy!* Sony DCR-HC40 is a big step up in build, image quality, stabilization, etc., but that's comparing a $600 to a sub-$300 camcorder now. Thus, 5 stars for the features & price.  When compared to the very best camcorders costing $$$, it's only average but that's comparing the gold standard to something far cheaper.  But if budget isn't a problem, the Sony is the better choice of the two.* More accessories on Sharp Japan's website, but you'll have to find an importer for those items.  Limited mostly to filters, extra battery, remote control (~$45), etc.  Remote control is hardly ever used - unless you're the type to plug the camcorder up to the TV far away from you because you don't have long enough cables to plop the camcorder in your lap for control.* DV transfer to XP PC works flawlessly and w/o problems.* Nice manual - explains every feature in depth.* Light and comfortably small! Almost like those smallest vertical camcorders. Can film for hours w/o weighing down the arms.* A little bit of tape motor noise if the scene is quiet - not like the Sony, which is silent - but nothing noticed nor obnoxious when used in normal noise level scenes.  Still, if you're filming something important, may get the Sony or an external mic & tape setup for the audio.* Low-light performance is good.  Grain level is decent and not glaring or bad although noticable, and you still can get a watchable image indoors at night.  (again, not the best vs. $$$ camcorders, but decent for a consumer's level camcorder at this price)* Overall, you can't go wrong with this low-priced, beginner's DV camcorder.  Really nothing wrong with it, and if handled properly, it'll give years of solid use and fun w/o a problem.

"Used this product to cut down a sim card from Rogers, ATT, Vodafone.  On the vodafone it cuts part of the metal sim card but it works just fine after being cut.  You have to trust it because at first I trimmed the card so it didnt cut the metal but this was the wrong thing to do. Just let the cutter do its job it lines up perfectly and the sim works fine.  The Vodafone had an additon section of the sim which is not used, even with my error I was able to salvage the sim and its working fine.

"The moment you hold the Soulra XL box in your hands, you feel as if you are getting something rather special. The boombox style and solar panel are a smart combination. The sound quality is powerful and crisp, even at loud volumes. And it does get quite loud.The unit out of the box is undoubtedly a pretty handsome, well-made device, though the solar panel itself makes the look a little odd when lifted for solar charging. The solar panel feels a little vulnerable to harm... and so it hasn't spent a lot of time outside. I don't want to test it's durability and regret it later.And therein lays my real problem with the Soulra. It's more or less designed for outdoor use (the rubber plug that protects the jacks is ample proof of that and a very smart feature), but I'm not super comfortable taking it anywhere other than the backyard. It is a great backyard music machine though.Another issue directly related is that the solar panel requires direct sunlight in order to effectively charge. This would be great in many parts of the country, but living in the Pacific NW makes this feature effective about three months out of the year. Since the unit is charging your ipod/iphone simultaneously as it plays it, you're double-draining your power source.The charge lasts for a few hours use. Unfortunately, when I go to use it a couple of days later, I need to plug it back in because the charge doesn't tend to hold for too long.Overall, I have to say that I really love my Soulra; I love the look, the quality, the sound and the fact that it's rechargeable, unfortunately I live where the sun is never all that plentiful and the battery is rated for five hours maximum (by the manufacturer), so it winds up being plugged in most of the time.  And really, I'm more than okay with that.",2,1,0.034272496,0.6985391,0.2671884

"After typing in ""iPhone cord G4"" and getting pages and pages and pages of results, I finally just bought this one. It was black, which I thought was interesting (and makes it easier to grab in the sea of white Apple cords we have around the house) and it was retractable. I like that feature. I basically needed one to keep near my computer to download stuff off my iPhone G4. I take a ton of photos and I find it faster to grab them with the USB cord than over the network.Of course, after I purchased the cord I realized it was for G3 phones. *sigh* But good news is that it works fine with my G4- my MacBook recognized the phone, the image transfer was fast, and it charged the phone while it was working.I have to admit, I'm not a fan of third party accessories for things like my phone and iPod shuffle because I have had bad experiences with them but this one looks a little better made than most- I like the ""squeeze to unlock"" feature on the cord and the construction looks decent. Only time will tell if it holds up, but for a couple of dollars... Anyway, if anything comes up, I will update this review. In the meantime, I'm happy with the cord and relieved it works with the G4.",2,2,0.028389102,0.17110538,0.8005055

"I've been working on formatting all my laptops and starting from scratch to get rid of the all the bloatware that the manufactures like to put on their laptops. This drive made it a pleasure to do so. I was easily able to backup all my data rather fast (even for USB 2.0 on the old laptop, you will still get better rates on older 2.0 devices due to no limitation in hdd).I'm not much of a person to use the seagate backup utility but I did give a shot on my newer laptop before formatting and it worked pretty good. They have nice explanations in video format of how to do everything within the system and it all works pretty good. The software and videos take up about 600MB of space on the drive. Not much compared to it's 500GB size. The software seems to work OK with windows but when you put it wit a MAC things don't work out so well... LOL. I ran into several issues on a friend Mac that just resulted in me not worrying about it.For me though, I don't bother with the 3rd party backup utilities. I'd rather have my files free and ready to go at anytime and just be able to drag and drop as normal elsewhere. Granted their newer system does allow for a lot of that. You can just copy them right off the harddrive at any point which is kind of nice. Unlike older backups that stored the files within folders you couldn't access unless you were in the software that created the backup. I'm strongly reconsidering using the software on a regular though, it's not bad at all. I just have a hard time getting used to a program doing my backups for me...As for transfer speeds:USB2.0 I saw transfer rates of 30+MB writing sustained for long periods of time, slowest it ever got was 15MB. Reading I was seeing as high as 28-32MB for transferring files back onto the system after format and re-install of OS (Windows 7 64b), slowest was near 18-19 range. So even if you are using this with an older 2.0 device you will certainly see some improvements over other drives out there for transfer.USB3.0: Speeds were all over the map, I saw no less than 50MB but did see upwards of 80MB and for extended periods as well. I will say, USB3.0 does make life easier...I do still like my eSATA port drives though. I do like seeing rates up in the hundreds constantly with those. I would like to see eSATA being adopted more by portable drives but for the most part I have resorted to buying eSATA cases and  dropping my favorite drives into them.CASE / FINISH, The fit and finish of this product is pretty nice overall though, it even comes with a nice protective plastic wrapper, I tend to leave those on for as long as possible so I don't scratch up the cases. The case is kind of a brushed metal anodized type finish, rather sharp looking when you peel back the plastic. It's not glossy though, which is a good thing, I don't like finger prints all over my devices and this finish will help to not show them.HEAT production: I didn't notice the case getting hot during transfers, I kind of expected it would but it remained relatively cool. I don't know if this is a good thing or not. I don't know if it's ""insulating"" the drive inside and keeping heat in or if it's just a cool running drive. I don't mind it when the case is used as a heat sink for the drive as it helps to dissipate the heat away from it.Indicator light: unlike a lot of other drives seagate decided to go with a white light indicator light versus a red or whatever. I kind of like the clean look of just a simple white light.Internal workings: I haven't dissected this drive/case just yet but I'm tempted to and if I can find a safe means to open it up and take some photos of the internals I will do so. I will have to work at with some of my plastic case tools so I don't damage the case and can put it back together.I found that the face of the case actually pulls off of the hard drive very easily and allows me to the plug it into any other SATA drive I have sitting around. That's a treat... this allows me to be able to get USB 3.0 interfaces to my other drives so I can easy transfer data around with 3.0 speeds.Overall, a pretty darn good product thus far. If I ever run into issues I will be sure to report back as issues tend to aggravate me into doing so, LOL.",2,2,0.00034575476,0.0011321801,0.9985221
"I was skeptical but after seeing the reviews thought I'd give it a try. I had no idea how hot it was getting underneat my laptop until after I got this heatshield. They really put out some heat so I guess I'm not surprised that they break down so much and the batteries fry and the internal components fizzle. I felt the hot air blowing out on the LH side after I placed my laptop on top. I then went over to the couch and placed the laptop on my lap with the heatshield as a barrier and felt no heat at all penetrating through the bottom. My laptop is 13"" wide and there is room to spare on either side and it elevates it enough so that cool air gets underneath my laptop. The raised rubber grippers I call them have vents so that no heat gets trapped but so that the laptop doesn't shift if you sit on a couch or recliner with your knees bent slightly upward. For a non-mechanical part I'm impressed. And here I was looking at these fan operated ones that were USB generated that would zap my battery power. No way.  My husband who is an I.T Manager he joked and teased me and calls it my notebook tray but I told him it's keeping the heat away from my lap. I will definately recommend it to others.",2,2,0.1146998,0.31314787,0.5721523
"Thermaltake Massive23 LX Laptop Notebook Cooler Oversized 230mm Blue LED Fan USB CLN0015The blue Led light is nice when turned on, and in conjunction with the fan you can tell the fan is running.

"1st:  The improvement in sound everyone mentions does indeed exist.  I have been extremely pleased with listening to old songs and hearing new sounds or instruments I don't recall having heard before. If you've read prior reviews of mine regarding headphones & earbuds I always make the qualifier that everyone's hearing is different, so please keep that in mind. With that said, you should give this product a whirl, but make certain you buy directly from Amazon so that if the iWow doesn't meet your expectations, you can return the product with no hassle.2nd:  Others have complained about the light, something I also have complaints about.  Not only is it annoying, but it, like the unit itself is a vampire sucking the battery life out of your Iphone specifically.  I've noticed a 25 to 35% decrease in battery life depending on whether or not the Iphone is in Airplane mode or not.  So for a long airplane flight, enjoy the sound while you can.  You might want to bring along an older Ipod you have hanging around, since you can't charge the Iphone (or any I product) while using the iWoW.  This is a definite deficit for us Iphone users.3rd:  The iWow requires you to plug your headphones into its donagle.  This is another downside for Iphone & Itouch users who have an intap control on their headphones, and it renders your microphone useless.In conclusion, I'm happy with the iWow, but because of it's downsides for the Iphone specifically I downgraded it to a 4 star rather than a 5 star, since it's not a product I'll be able to use with as great a frequency as I'd like.  And, now that I've heard the difference, it's hard to go back to listening to songs on my Iphone without it.",2,2,0.032487024,0.08708934,0.88042367

"I got the camera and was presently surprised to find that the camera came with a flash in the box too. I did not see any other sellers offering the camera+lens+flash for less than 450 - so i felt like I got a good deal at only 339.Even better the ef90 flash can be used as an optical master for my other canon flashes. I would not buy the flash by itself as it is pretty slow to charge if using it as a main flash but as an optical master - it is wonderful.For the price and size this camera is great! I could not find any other  changeable lens cameras with a lens and flash for even twice the price that had audio input jack - which makes it fantastic for shooting real video. The Internal mic's work well and are quite sensitive. The camera also allows configuration of manual audio levels. Which is a really nice touch if you want to shoot and have great audio.Overall this product - and this seller exceeded all my expectations. The eos camera is a great camera for the price. It cannot fully compete with full blown 35mm sensor dslr cameras that cost over 1000 dollars - but thats ok because this one is the price of a point and shoot, but with lots of great pro features - and - you can put very good high quality lenses on it.Finally ordering from the third party seller means no sales tax, which saved even more!The cons are present in all other photography cameras I have found including other canon cameras and mostly relate to video. The camera has a 30minute recording limit for video, and cannot display audio meters while recording which I find disappointing. However this camera actually will record in WAV, which the sony NEX and Samsung  NX2000 cameras do not.Overall - if you want a great small camera that can also be used to record video with external sound without breaking the bank - get this camera.I was not disappointed.",2,2,0.00095606234,0.0025722145,0.99647176

"These mounts are stronger than I expected.  As other Amazon buyers have said, the supplied drywall anchors are a bit wanting.The mounts are smaller than I expected though the dimensions should have made that clear.  However, since the mounts are strong and capable, smaller is an advantage for adjustment and visibility reasons.  I was a little concerned when I first saw the small package, but not any more.I prefer the self drilling/thread in style anchors, so I purchased SnapSkru SP self-drilling drywall anchors - the #8 size here in Amazon.One cool part about these anchors:  The supplied bevel head screws that come in the AM10 kit work perfectly with those anchors.  Otherwise, I'd have had to use a panhead screw from the anchor kit in the countersunk holes in the wall mounts.One other tip:  I found I could get a couple degrees more down angle adjustment if I snipped the plastic wings off the 2 lower plastic wingnuts.  Otherwise, the wings can hit the speaker cabinet if adjusted pretty low.  I was still easily able to finger tighten the modified adjusting wingnuts.With the speakers up very high, it was a little tricky getting the speaker mounted portion to drop onto the axles of the wall mounted pieces but I could probably get it quicker next time.Although the supplied drywall anchors were wanting just as others have said, the most important portion of the product exceeded my expectations for design and quality so I rated this product 5 stars.I saw some other Amazon reviewers saying the supplied screws for attaching to the speaker cabinet are easy to strip, so I used some larger #8 x 1"" self threading screws and as others suggested, pre drilled the holes with a small bit.  This worked perfectly.BTW, I mounted my surrounds on these mounts with the speaker cabinets arranged horizontally.  This allowed more down adjustment which I needed but does reduce the right/left adjustment.  It was the right arrangement for my setup as I have the speakers aimed perfectly for my room.I highly recommend this product but suggest you obtain better drywall anchors if attaching to drywall.",2,2,0.0006573927,0.0077456436,0.991597
So you want your RT to stay in one piece for longer? That's a case for serious protection. I have heard that RT's are prone to screen damage due to &#34;edge strikes&#34; that crack the display.  Made me nervous! So I tried this case.... I was surprised by how nice it was for the price. Came with a stylus too!  The angle adjustments are easy on the eyes and it's not as bulky as my old case. I like that it covers most of the RT sides while still leaving access open to the power and data ports. Very handy!,2,2,0.00030871003,0.002424799,0.99726653

"I absolutely love the Roku, of which I bought multiple refurbished units.  The audio and video quality are top notch.  Highly recommended.But I had a Dickens of a time getting the remotes to pair with the base units, so I thought I'd share what I've learned.I kept trying to pull the batteries and push the pairing button, as shown in the little manual, but it wasn't working.  Here's what finally worked on all my units.Put the batteries into the remote FIRST, before you plug in the Roku base unit.  Have the remote right next to the Roku base unit when you supply power to the base unit.  The base unit will then properly search for, and find, the remote and pair with it during the boot-up process.  I tried it every other way I could think of, but couldn't get the two to pair properly.  This method did the trick.

"I usually avoid Netgear products after bad experience with my old wireless-G router and I had since switched to a basic Linksys N-Router. My house is pretty big and the router and my living room and master is over 100 feet and 2 exterior walls apart. So when I got the Linksys N router I thought my wireless hiccups will finally go away.Despite the hype about N, I still can't get excellent connection using N routers (not dual band) and G/N-cards. So I decided to switch to wired PowerLine adapters and given them a try. I needed to also connect my Blue-Ray player and Sling-Box which only afccepts ethernet connection that i don;t have in my living room.So I started looking for Powerline products and I found in this area NETGEAR leads LinkySys in innovation and quality. The products have matured a lot since those slow 14Mbps adapters. I had a special need in that , I wanted both Transmitting and Receiving ends of the kit to have more than 4 ports.XEB1004 is the only product I found that has 4 ports both in the Tx and Rx adapters. So if you have your modem far away from your office/living room that your wireless does not connect, you can do something like this:1. Connect your Broadband MODEM LAN cable output to any one of the 4 ports in one of the 2 adapters in the kit2. Connect any of the other 3 ports in the Tx adapter to say your LAN PC, NAS, Network printer etc etc3. Connect the other switch in the klt in your office/living room. You can biu another single adapter as well.4. Connect your Work PC, Sling box, Blue-Ray player, PS3 etc to any of the 4 ports in teh Rx adapter.5. Optionally you can even connect your old wireless router to ANY one of the switch that gives you best coverage.Its has been running PERFECTLY for multiple weeks now. Streaming non-HD video like a charm. Download movies , sling box , everything works great and fast. You don't need the 200Mbps version unless you are moving large files between PCs in your household often. I also trialed and tested the new 200 Mbps Powerline adapter from Netgear and after repeated test found no diff in performance for what I do and hence i returned and it didn;t have 4 port in teh Tx, only in the Rx side. Linksys doesn't even have a 4 x 4 powerline powerline adapter.Advantages over wireless product:1. NO SOFTWARE TO INSTALL (all thoughthey gave a CD, god know for what)2. NO CONFIGURATION NEEDED. JUST LITERALLY PLUG AND PLAY (wow I thought only APPLE can do that)3. NO 192.168.0.1 login and debug problems4. NO SECURITY PROBLEMS, NO WEP2 vs WPA debates, NO PASSWORDS TO REMEMBER, NO INTERFERENCE WITH PHONES5. NO MORE LONG ""WAITING TO CONNECT"" wireless card when coming out of Standby mode.None of that junk.EXCELLENT PRODUCT. JUST WHAT THE NETWORK DOCTOR PRESCRIBED.

"This is the 3rd Ipod proctector product I have tried and the only one that I can say I am satisfied with.  The black rubberized ""skin"" of the eVo3 Eclipse looks good and fits my Ipod video perfectly.  The Eclipse's removeable belt clip has proven reliable enough for working around the house and quick runs to the store.  The case cutout(earphone jack) and flap(USB connector)easily accomodate both my USB cable connector and earphone plug.  The touch wheel is very responsive through the eVo3 skin.  I never use the locking slider on my Ipod so I can't comment on the ease or difficulty of using that switch through the skin.  The main reason I bought this case was because it provides a crystal clear view of my Ipod Video's screen.  Yipeee!  I was dissapointed with the previous two products I owned because their screen protection solutions left my screen looking like crap.  With  the Elipse case your screen is securely covered by a solid piece of clear plastic that does not touch the Ipod screen.  If I could change one thing about the Elipse case I might add a scratch resistant treatment, similar to what's available for eyeglasses, to the clear plastic cover.  Then it would stay looking perfect for the life of the product.  The Eclipe case may not satisfy everyone but it's a nearly perfect solution for me.

"I have had the Olympus PL1 and a Sony HX9V for a couple of months now so I have had a good opportunity to compare them.  I bought the Sony mainly as a hiking and family occasion camera.  The zoom range, macro focus, low light level performance, and pocket size are all I could expect.  I then tried to use it to take some coin pictures and was very disappointed.  With no RAW mode there was very poor fine detail.  The Sony has more megapixels than it can focus sharply.I bought the Olympus for the coin pictures and the detail it can achieve is outstanding.  It does not focus close up so I tried extension tubes.  The focus outside of a very small spot in the center was very fuzzy.  I tried close up lenses.  At first I had serious chromatic aberration at the edges.  Change in lighting and camera angle solved that.  The coin pictures are very nice.  I can see more detail than by looking at the coins even with a magnifying glass.  So how does it compare with the Sony?  The Sony wins in all areas except for taking sharp pictures.  Sony goes hiking and to get togethers, Olympus stays home and takes coin pictures.I have on Olympus OM2 and 4 associated lenses.  I was expecting their large lenses and multiple elements to out perform the stock lens that came with the PL1.  Much to my surprise the stock lens out performed all the old lenses in terms of sharpness",2,0,0.64979064,0.32551455,0.024694841
"UPDATE: The more I use the keyboard, the more I enjoy it. Typing has become easier with time--my finger spread has adjusted after more use.  Tweaking the design would still be preferable.  The initial problem with the 'Enter' key has seemingly corrected itself, although I do have to turn it off and then on again to get the keyboard to recognize it rather than the touch screen.  In any case, I'm more pleased than before.  I have increased the rating by one star.This keyboard is a very convenient tool when compared to the touch-screen keyboard on the Kindle.  The look is attractive and it is amazingly lightweight.  There were no problems pairing the device with my Kindle Fire and I was able to use it immediately after charging.  As many others have documented, the keys are 'extremely small' making it challenging to type without error and to know where your fingers are oriented (I am a female with average-sized hands).  A slight change in the keyboard layout with comparable dimensions would fix this problem.  There are a few keyboards by other manufacturers that has accomplished this style configuration successfully, making the typing experience much more enjoyable.  These options are typically more pricey--$70-$100.  Another quirk that I have found is that the 'Enter' key does not work when executing from the browser box. Once you type in a description to search, you have to arrow to the listing below to access the site rather than just hitting 'Enter'.I just received this keyboard on 1/7/13 and will continue using it and exploring its functionality.  Will post updates accordingly.",2,2,0.0028228571,0.008233657,0.98894346
"A great product got better. The 537H is the successor to the LT37HVS which was a great product with a heavy internet following because it provided a excellent picture at a very reasonable price. So how did Syntax top the LT37HVS well they kiazen`d(fixed) its few failings the SD picture, ATSC tuner and the remote while retaining the excellent picture and the great price point.The quality is fantastic, watching PBS's nature shows just shows off the picture.The ATSC tuner works great, I live in a rural area and many of our digital stations operate at low power but with a good indoor power antenna I picked up all the broadcast channels without problem. WKET transponder is a good 40 miles away and operates below 100W but came in with no dropouts.Where this television really separates it self from the other low end HD panels is the SD picture quality. Low end panels normally fail when it up converts an SD 480i signal, the cheap video processors usual included cannot process a decent looking SD picture which a real annoyance since the majority on content will be SD until we go all Digital in 2009 or later if you are using cable sources. The SD up conversion looks great, nearly as good as the up conversion at the local broadcasting stations.Pros:Great contrast ratio 1:1600Excellent colors, bright (though the darks took a little adjustment to get right)An ATSC tuner that works great.Lot's of different sources at the back.Nice stylingCons: (Silly small things)A little thick for a flat panel.Menu system takes a little getting used too.I personally believe that it will be hard to find a better 37"" HD panel at this price point.",2,2,0.0019111459,0.004001428,0.99408746

"TiVo's claim that they'll change the way you watch TV is completely true.  Being able to pause or replay whatever you're currently watching to grab a snack, answer a call, etc. is great.  You can't imagine how helpful it is  to have almost two weeks of programming information available to pick and  chose what to record for the next few days.I'd recommend the 30hr unit  over the 14hr if you can afford it.  After you start searching the two week  guide by program name, channel name, favorite channels, or by time of day  you'll quickly find plenty of things you want to record.DirecTV viewers  will especially find this useful...it makes all those channels much more  manageable, and I prefer the TiVo on-screen guide to the one my DSS box  provided.All of the TiVo menus are well thought out, attractive, and  *very* easy to use.  They include lots of cables - including S-Video, a  phone jack splitter (nice touch), and other goodies so almost anyone will  find everything they need to hook TiVo up right out of the box.  The User's  Guide is helpful too, for people who are a little less sure of themselves  around stuff like this.I picked TiVo over ReplayTV because of their  close alliance with DirecTV (DirecTV has invested in them), and from  reading other people's comments in newsgroups and other forums.  After I  spent about half an hour going through the program guide and giving various  programs 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' ratings (one of the cooler features  of TiVo), it came up with a whole bunch of other programs it suggested I  might like.I'm probably sounding like a company spokesperson, but I'm  not, I'm just a *very* happy new user of TiVo!",2,2,0.0008040001,0.0025620272,0.99663407

"I was originally planning to buy Dimage X1. However, after some researches, I decided to go to Panasonic. This camera is just what I wanted, compact-sized(size of cigarette pack) and image stabilized.For outside shooting(under daylight), it is not really necessary to change many settings, but automatic shooting is good enough like most cameras. However, this camera shines for indoor shooting with the image stablization.For those who are new to camera, let me say that image stabilizer is not a miracle-maker letting you to get clean and sharp picture in the middle of earthquake. However, it is capable of compensating shake of hand holding camera good enough if used with some physical stabilization, or if there were nowhere to put your arms, with timed shutter. This camera has 2-sec and 10-sec timer, and I mostly use 2-sec without using flash indoors. (Force of pressing shutter may give camera shake that image stabilizer cannot compensate, so timed shutter is very handy.)Result? Good enough, although I could see some noise indoors with automatic ISO setting(it usually sets ISO to 200 for some reason).One thing: most of my indoor shootings are still-life(many times in macro mode). I haven't tested it for portrait yet, but I guess that shooting portrait in some distance may require less concern for hand-shake, unless under low-light condition.Battery duration seems very good, too. However, extra battery will be nice.Complaint: (maybe or maybe not)1. Single file of 6 megapixel picture usually costs between 2 and 2.5 megabytes, but Panasonic only included 16MB memory. Is it a joke?2. It's not really a complaint, but big LCD screen means more chances of getting scratches.

"This is the third and best PowerShot I've owned. The last one needed photoshop adjustment on nearly every shot and this one rarely needs much of anything.

Now to change modes and go through the menus you must negotiate a confusing, complicated relationship between two buttons which I have yet to master consistently.  They eliminated the dial on top because it was easy to accidentally change modes, but I had long since learn to check it so for me it was an unnecessary and unwelcome 'fix.'The viewfinder to me is essential for composing shots and getting hard to find. I keep the display turned off and the batteries last forever.

They've made a quality, sturdy, snugly fitting cable that delivers video and images from your phone to your big screen TV.

"Although the description of the Magellan Premium Car Kit doesn't say that this supports the iPhone 4, I saw several comments from buyers who said that they were using it with that phone. Trust me - it doesn't work with the iPhone 4!I returned the first one, thinking that I just had a bad device. The second one did the same thing. The power cable ""lights up"" and you can definitely see that the Bluetooth connection is working, and even pair with your iPhone 4. However, the Car Kit doesn't charge the iPhone 4, and that's a problem. GPS usage tends to really suck down your battery life, and without the ability to charge the phone while driving, it's worthless.On the other hand, it is a well-made product, as one would expect from Magellan. The mount is very sturdy, and holds the iPhone securely. The speaker is quite loud, too.Regretfully, I'm going to have to buy a Car Kit that will charge the iPhone 4 as well, so I'm hoping the TomTom Car Kit works.",2,0,0.7669771,0.17534298,0.057679962
"I'm generally not a fan of ear buds, but the reviews sold me on this item and it has turned out to be a great purchase! There's a person a few aisles over at work who constantly hacks, numerous people have various noise-isolating/canceling ear buds and headphones ranging from really cheap to overpriced Bose as a result. The gamble paid off and I really do not hear any noise outside of the music when I have these in my ears, to the point that somebody managed to scare the crap out of me since I didn't hear her behind me. Might be time to get a mirror for my cube as well. Audio quality is also probably the best I have heard from ear buds; bass isn't too heavy but you can certainly notice it if you set it high and other tones sound great as well.

"This router is great.  I've now happily ditched my old router and the RE1000 wireless repeater that I used to need to get a good signal in the Living Room.  This thing is powerful enough to give good throughput to any room in my house, despite my less than ideal placement.  Where my old router refused to do more than 20 Mbps even if you were in the same room, this will hit my farthest room with 50 Mbps+ speedtest results.  Even with only 1 bar of signal on my phone I get great throughput that doesn't slow down my downloads.Setup was relatively easy and I was quickly able to get both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands up and running.  After setting up my wireless networks it tried to update the firmware and froze, but I was able to go to the Asus website and manually download the latest firmware.  I just had to close the frozen tab and then open a new one to log back into the router setup page and manually update the firmware.  There are some custom firmwares for it but I haven't felt the need to try any of those out yet as the stock firmware comes with a lot of useful options.This router came highly recommended and I can see why.  There's a newer model available that supports wireless AC but is quite a bit more expensive.

"I'm a music enthusiast and listen to different genres and lean towards pop (and currently in a JPop retro loop with Chage & Aska).  I prefer traditional cans and the last pair I bought are also Sony's, MDR-V6's.  I've got some expensive open air Sennheiser's and a pair of noise-cancelling Bose cans as well.I'm using the medium (green center) ear buds that were already pre-attached to start with.My music source is usually an iPhone, iPod or a new Nano and for critical listening I use a cMoy headphone amp from JDS Labs with the optional line-out cable.  99% of my music is high bit-rate lossy.The sound is hugely fuller than the OEM buds that come with the Apple products.  Bass on the Sony's is better and you get a better sense of a virtual stage.  While illogical, channel separation seems wider, but I think it's an effect of the fuller sound.  I'm not into really loud music, however when pushed, I noticed the earbuds started hitting their output limits earlier than the can style MDR-V6's I'm using for comparison.  I don't listen to loud music other than for a short session related to testing these ear buds or trying to hear something buried in a music track.

"I give this little unit high marks, especially for the small size, light weight and low heat/noise.  I didn't expect a super bright picture but in my dimmed office it does a great job on a 60"" wide screen.  I did buy a reasonably high gain screen because I don't need wide angle viewing.  I admit it gets used for showing movies and games from time to time and the wife loves it.  Resolution is really quite good and setup was simple.  I mount it on a camera tripod so it can be placed to fill the screen (no zoom, etc.).  My only complaints:1.  I use HDMI input but want to use external stereo amp & speakers.  The internal speaker is useless and there is no way to get good audio out.  I tried using the headphone jack and got too much hum.  I had to extract the audio at the source - not run it through the the HDMI cable & HS201 (for example, use separate stereo out from my XBOX 360).2.

"Ok, I bought my nephew the Galaxy Tab 8.0 for Christmas and have been using it and enjoyed it so, that I was about to buy the same thing for me.I seen that the GT Pro 8.4 had come out and had a better screen than the GT 8.0, so I thought I would study a little about it, read a few reviews online and then I would decide on which to get.I can say that I definitely chose right.Just some quick Pro's from my use so far :Width wise it seems smaller than the GT 8.0.Screen is heads above the GT 8.0The .4&#34; screen size is NOT noticeable at all.  My hands hold the GT Pro as well as the GT 8.0.Loads apps/books faster than the GT 8.0.  It should with a quadcore processor.The fake leather backing on the back of the GT Pro is nice, it isn't as likely to slide on any surface that is not flat.Charge seems to be holding up, but I have only been using it recently for reading books.The speaker seem good considering this thing really isn't being advertised as a mp3 player.Some quick Con's:When I slide my finger to go to another screen, it stutters at times. (haven't had time to see if there is a fix or not for this)The fake leather on the back just seems tacky and not right for the GT Pro.  I don't hate it, but it seems something better could be there instead.The speakers and sound aren't what they should be, in my opinion.  Maybe they should invest into Beats audio or some other brand of audio to up the sound quality.  The GT Pro, should have better sound, not just a better screen.This has been a pleasure to use so far, though I clearly have not put it completely through its' paces, I have used it and abused it a bit, and it does very well.I would recommend this over the Galaxy Tab 8.0 in a heartbeat.If you are struggling between the 2, the Pro is the one to get, even at the cost, but you can't go wrong with either really, but the Pro is a step up that you can see and feel.",2,2,0.09150596,0.23737258,0.6711215
"Just got it a couple of weeks ago and so far I'm very happy with it.  The screen is bright and beautiful (LED technology) and it comes with an HDMI connection.  And all the specs are good.As always, the built-in speakers are completely useless - sound like crap (I still don't get why they even bother putting it in).  I gotta say the vertical viewing angle is not the greatest (looking up at the screen is slightly darker...looking down at it brighter).  But then again it's very much a standard for monitors in this price range.In the end, there's one thing you have to keep in mind: while it's probably one of the very best monitors you can get for under $200 (if not THE)...it's not exactly the best monitor money can buy.  Having done my research, the ones starting $400-$500 range are basically in a different ballpark.  So you pretty much get what you pay for.  And in this case, for this price, you get PLENTY...in fact WAY MORE than you ever could before.  So if you're cool with not having ""the best"" for now...and need a good monitor for cheap - this is the one.  For sure.",2,2,0.0003789684,0.0024400745,0.99718094

In my experience It has not froze or experieced some of the quirks of apps not doing what you expect (looking at you XB1).

"I have no idea why Amazon is charging so much money for this thing, I got mine for the Google advertised price of $199 at Best Buy.Here is my review:This little computer is fantastic. We purchased it for my mother in law who is not great with computers. All she cares about is going online to shop and play facebook games and sometimes video chat.Speed:- The computer is very very fast with everything it does. Web sites load fast.- The comuter boots up and is ready to surf the web in 30 seconds or less.- Opening pictures and other files go very fast as well.Chrome Operating System:- Yes it will take a little getting used to if you use windows every day, but trust me its not bad.- I was able to hook up my external Hard drive and copy over some family pictures very easily and quickly. You just have to use the ""files"" app.- There is no support for Skype, however, this is a google computer, so you will need a G mail account which means you can use Google Hangouts to video chat, I actually like it better than skype. (skype will eventually launch a chrome app).Other notes:- The battery is very small, around 3 hours of usage, so make sure you are someone who is always going to have it plugged in, if not, you may need to spend the extra $50 and get the Samsung Chromebook which has a 6 hour battery.- The computer comes free with 100GB of google drive cloud storage which is great if you are an Android device user.- supports normal plug and use USB mice and other devices. I purchased a $15 wireless mouse and it works without any set up or tinkering.Summary:If you are someone who needs a simple laptop to do video chatting, web surfing, shopping, and play online games, this is perfect for you. I cannot over-state how fast this computer is at everything it does, its amazing. There is no waiting (provided you have a decent internet speed).What more needs to be said?

"The Great:+++ Tiny form factor, the size of a smart phone but with optical zoom.+++ No external lens extension makes lens damage a lot less likely, and it stay tiny even when on.+++ Automatic panoramic stitching makes capturing wide vistas a breeze.The Good:++ It takes a solid photo during the day and in low light it's still okay, mostly due to the BSI sensor they're using now.++ The intelligent auto is pretty smart about detecting scenes and changing the settings to fit.The Passable:+ The touchscreen is responsive, but it takes the whole back of the camera, making it easy to fat finger the wrong settings.+ The zoom is a tiny nub that's functional and keeps the size down, but it gets uncomfortable to use after a lot of continuous use.The Bad:- After a month mine got a bright vertical bar of light stuck on the LCD, making the camera more or less unusable (it functioned, but it was hard to look at or select some options). Sony support was an easy online form and they fixed it at no cost. However I was without it for almost 3 weeks (it was the holiday season).- The widest aperture is f/3.5, so it isn't as useful (for low light or soft backgrounds) as many of the thicker Cyber-shots are.- Deleting photos can be confusing since it is done individually or on a daily basis (no delete all), also burst more photos are stacked together (since it won't burst more than 10 photos I don't know why I need this since it slows down reviewing).My Recommendations:> If size is the main consideration and you want image quality that bests a camera phone, then this is a great camera. The sensor is top notch and Sony has put a lot of exciting features in this generation of Cyber-Shot. I haven't seen better in this size package (including the EXLIMs). The touch screen though is the Achilles heal for this unit, since its used for both composing and control any sort of scratches or damage causes problems for both.> If you like the pros of this camera, but not the cons and can live with a slightly larger camera... theSony DSC-WX10 Cyber-Shot 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with 7x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom G Lens and Full HD 1080/60i Video (Black)is an excellent camera and faster to use in-spite of the missing touch screen and extending lens (it's even faster once you turn off the help screens). It also has a bigger and faster lens so you can take a wider variety of photos and for a little longer into the night before needing to use the flash.

"I own two of these Harmony 650 remotes (living room and bedroom).  One is over a year old and the other is about 4 months old.  Both have been working like champs.

AA batteries are cheap and easily replaceable.I have seen the resetting issue that most people are complaining about.  Seems to be caused by battery jostling that resets the remote when power is temporarily disconnected.  I fixed this by folding a strip of paper towel and stuffing it atop the batteries and against the door.  It ensures the batteries stay in place and don't jostle while the remote is in motion.

I purchased two of these cables to make long runs from an old video game console (Sega Genesis) that was modified for S-Video output to my A/V receiver and another from my old CRT television (for gaming) to my A/V receiver. The cables worked excellent especially the audio portion. I saw no distortion in audio or video. When plugged into the receiver the picture actually became a bit more colorful than my usual cables. I can't 100% say that this was because of the cables quality but it was a nice bonus. The gaming has improved due to these cables and I plan to buy at least one more set to use on another vintage gaming console modified for S-Video.The only negative is that the audio cables are separated by the S-Video cable meaning that there is a gap between the two audio cables which can cause some kinking in the wires and make non-standard setups a little difficult to plug in. The cord for the connectors is quite short and you can't separate it like on many other cables.

"My previous PC (which is still in use) was an excellent computer, but in the past three years a lot of improvements have become standard issue on PCs while I had to keep buying adapters and dongles to use new technology on my older machine. I am delighted that this computer came standard with Bluetooth capabilities, USB 3.0 ports and HDMI support. With this unit I was able to hook up my bluetooth keyboard, wireless mouse, and HDMI monitor and really minimize the amount of cords going into the back of my computer and the amount of stationery devices on my desktop. The PC was entirely hooked-up in less than a minute. Actually booting up the PC for the first time with Windows 8 also seemed faster than my Windows 7 launch. Be forewarned that you need to sign-in with an existing Windows Live ID or create one.The design of this computer is very attractive. It stacks up as slightly taller (about 1/2"") than my last HP PC. This largely seems to be because of the top-mounted headphone, Microphone, and USB 2.0 jacks. These jacks face the back of the computer. The top of the PC (minus the dash for the plugs), has a beveled shape which makes it nice for charging and storing devices since it minimizes the chances for accidentally knocking a peripheral off the top of the PC (see my picture uploaded by the product images). The splashes of red color you see in the photograph are actually light strategically peeking out from the case to lend a specific aesthetic to the tower.I wanted to focus on the details above first since the product description page offers almost all the item hardware and software specifics an individual would need to know. However, I do have a few comments about those also.The computer does not have a VGA input, but it includes a dongle that adapts your VGA cable to fit in the DVI port. I was delighted by this because I was able to use my HDMI cable from my monitor to this computer and use my existing VGA cable to keep my older computer hooked up to the same monitor (the HP w2207h).It only took me a couple of days to get accustomed to the Windows 8 interface, but I can see how it would be a bit overwhelming to someone not already familiar with apps in another OS or without a touch device that maximizes it. My bluetooth keyboard (the PC comes with both a standard cord-attached USB keyboard and mouse) allows me to scroll through open apps and the other actions are easy enough to do with a standard mouse and the use of the Windows start button on keyboards. I found that claims about being able to reach the old desktop are greatly exaggerated unless you pin everything you love to the taskbar since there is no way to add the classic start screen button to the desktop view without installing third-party software and tweaks. For those who do not want to adapt, this computer has such incredible hardware that buying it with the Windows 8 and then installing Windows 7 would be an option provided you have the tech chops to handle any potential driver recognition issues that would pop up - HP warns that this is a possibility - there is a Computer World article this some depth if you search their website.So far, I have installed the full Microsoft Office Professional Suite and one of the design variations of the Adobe Creative Suite 5.0. It features a little over half of the CS programs. After installing these programs and the initial launch, I could click on one of the programs, like Photoshop Extended Edition, and have it fully up and ready to run in 1.8 seconds. Word launches in approximately the same amount of time. For the price of this PC and considering the hardware, I would expect that, but it is still incredible to watch. My old computer had an AMD Quad Core processor with acceptable speed, so I unsure if this unit would be faster, and I definitely should not have been. I've never had these programs launch this fast. Also, the somewhat large installs barely made a blip in the hard disk space.Windows 8 and HP have added a few new features to the computer that many of us will probably appreciate. Now, after connecting the computer with my Facebook account and iPod touch, the ""My Photos/Pictures"" shows off both my uploaded pictures and the photos from Facebook and the iPod all in one place instead of my needing to manually pull them in from the device. These can be browsed both in the standard manner from the desktop screen or with the ""Photos"" tile. The ""Photos"" tile offers full screen images without prompting and features handy delete, rotate, and crop buttons when you right click. HP also has a ""connected remote"" you can download as a smartphone or tablet app which allows you to play videos and music from your smartphone or iPod. I like this feature a lot because it kept me from having to import the music I have on my iPod that isn't stored in Apple's Cloud into this PC for listening. You can just play it through the system from your phone or player. When I saw the computer specifics mention a remote, I presumed it was a physical remote, but this is much better. Another really nice improvement with this PC is that I did not have to manually install my HP wireless printer, the PC recognized it automatically.I only have one complaint. I am a bit surprised that this unit did not come standard with a Blu-ray player installed. I have seen a Blu-Ray player featured on many PCs with a lower cost and that aren't geared toward gamers or massive resource consumers like myself. There is an expansion bay that would allow me to install one, but it feels like something that should be a given in a product of this cost at this point in time. However, I am not ducking a star on the product since it is clear in the product specifications that only a combo DVD player/burner is included.When reviewing an item like this, I always feel like I am forgetting to mention something important, so feel free to ask me a question by leaving a comment if there is something you want to know.",2,2,0.0005638297,0.0008444973,0.9985917

"Duration of Owning/use: 2 yearsIssues: nilWould I buy it again: YESWould I recommend it to a friend: YESI've owned this FM transmitter for going on 2 years (in at least 6 different vehicles ranging in year from 1997 to 2010) and have to say that it was well worth the money and has had no issues whatsoever with transmission.  I've opted to unlock the modes as said in a previous review to get a wider range of frequencies but have rarely strayed from the 87.9 channel setting even in places where I normally get some Canadian interference with normal radio stations here in the States.  I've used this product from PA to South Carolina and back without issues in sound quality or having to change the station more than a few times.  The only time I get interference is waiting at the new traffic lights (which even interfere with my normal car and truck radios) so I'm not too worried about it.  Also no issues while using it in downtown atmospheres of cities like Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and Cleveland.Of note though is that you do have to turn your radio volume up a little bit higher than normal... I personally do not see this as a flaw in the device but rather an expected consequence of the method of use.  I'm sure I could find a better station setting to use but what's the use if 87.9 works without a problem, I'll gladly turn the volume knob two extra clicks.  The ""search"" function to find three random stations that should be good for transmission doesn't always find a good station so that kind of stinks but again... who cares, it's a device the size of a pink eraser some of us used to use in grade school not a $150 Sirius radio (which I've seen fail more times than this transmitter at maintaining signal).

"I searched high and low for a new headset that wouldn't disappoint (like some of my recent purchases...).  This is not the most expensive headset I have purchased, but it is of the highest quality construction.  From the thick cabling, to the mic, and the cans themselves, this product is solid.  The comfort is out of this world.  I have yet to feel ear fatigue using these, even through extended gaming sessions (notice I'm too ashamed to state the length of time :P ).  The cushioned ear cups and headband are very comfortable.  The cans are so big that they completely envelop my ears, leaving them in their natural state.  I can't emphasize this enough, no ear fatigue.  The open design lets my ears breathe and lend to the comfort.  Some pay prefer a closed design or leatherette cushions.  I've owned some and they just weren't my cup of tea.  Your ears get that nasty suffocated feeling over time.I researched and tested several products before this purchase.  I own theHT OMEGA Claro Halo XT PCI Sound Card, so I definitely wanted a non-usb set to take advantage of it.  I tested numerous 5.1, 7.1, 12.5, etc headsets...  There may be 4 or 5 drivers in each ear, but how big do you think they are?  What kind of audio quality will you get out of those tweeters?  I can tell you, it's pretty craptacular.  Check if your sound card is equipped with Dolby Headphone.  If it is, then you're golden.  Directional audio in all of my games, movies, and Mumble server sounds fantastic.  The surround quality is on par with my 5.1 speaker setup.There's a troubling trend recently where these high end headsets skimp on the mic quality.  I've done comparison recordings and asked my gaming buds, I sound much better.  I'm not recording an album with these or anything.  If I'm paying for a product in the price range, the mic should sound better than a $5 clip-on mic.  Do a search on the Tube for headset mic tests and you'll see what I mean.I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  I get precise directional audio from my movies and games, and excellent quality while listening to music (unlike those ""5.1"" jobs).

The ear-cup is almost the same size as your typical CD-rom. So go figure.Comfort: The ear-cup is one of the best and most comfortable that I've used. I'd say its as good as the Bose QC series. The memory foam used as the ear cup is soft and it won't 'push' too hard on your head. I'm wearing a spectacles & I'd say that its spectacles-friendly too cause the headphones itself does not push your specs hard and leave that indentation mark on the side of your head. Personally, I use the headphones for approximately 2 hours at a time because it can get warm in the ear-cup and cause your ears to get warm/hot. But a couple of minutes break to let your ear and the inside of the ear-cups to cool off should do the trick for another round of awesome music/movie experience.Sound: According to Sony, this has a 3Hz-28000Hz range so you will be able to listen that low frequency sound or bass in your music. I've tried the frequency bass test and it's accurate, at least up to 10Hz. A 20Hz-xxxxxHz headphones will not allow you to listen to the frequency made below 20Hz in your music but since this Sony headphones goes well below 5Hz, you will be able to notice that low frequency sound and etc. I might be wrong though, it all depends on your devices, ears & etc. Bass is nice, not too overpowering. Mids and Highs are good as well. Not as good as Bose QC that I've tried. This is not a NC headphones so you might be able to listen to background noises unless you crank up the volume when listening to musics & etc. Another thing to consider is audio/sound leak. This may be a circum-aural closed headphones but that does not prevent the audio/sound form inside of the ear-cup to 'leak' to the outside. I've tried playing songs to their max volume and trust me, this headphones act like a speaker already. Its THAT loud! I played numerous numbers of songs ranging from rock, hip-hop, classical & etc at max volume and you can listen to the songs 12 feet away! Like I said, its like a mini speakers! So that's another thing to consider.Construction: Simply awesome. Sony has done a good job with their materials' build and construction. They never fail to impress me. This Sony headphones looks like it will last for a couple of years with good care. The flat cable is nice for me. Some may not like it that way but its more to personal preference. The only downside I have with this headphone is the length of the cable. It's too short. It may be sufficient for portable use when you hook up the headphones on you ipod/mp3 place your ipod/mp3 in your pocket but when you hook it up to your laptop/desktop (devices that are not portable) you will find it hard to reach around because the cable is too short. Its around 6~7 feet long. Other than that I'm satisfied with the overall construction quality. There's some aluminum on the headphones, some plastic, but what would you expect form a $100 headphones? But the plastic is of high quality though.Overall, I'm satisfied with this headphone just for indoor use. The size prevents me from using it outdoor. If you wanna buy a headphones for outdoor use, try the Sony XB-500 or the Sony XB-300. They are a little smaller and more appropriate-looking for outdoor. It may be a little uncomfortable after 1 hour of use due to the heating in the ear-cups. But the sound quality is great, the construction is great. Another job well done by Sony. I'm happy with this purchase. Recommended!",2,2,0.00034235453,0.0011269588,0.9985306
"I recently purchased an LG2431 LED monitor and constantly felt like it was lacking.  I exchanged it for the ViewSonic VX2453mh which happens to be at the same exact price.  What a difference.  The ViewSonic is a FAR superior monitor in Black level, color depth, clarity, brightness etc.  Even simple things like the sturdiness of the base is much better.  The LG constantly wiggled as I typed... The ViewSonic VX2453mh still has some vibration, but it's not nearly as bad... And what should I expect, I'm not exactly breaking the bank on this thing.Pros: Once Calibrated it is awesome!  Brightness, color, clarity, and the antiglare screen are GREAT.Cons: 1. It takes some time to calibrate.  Don't expect it to be great out of the box, you will be disappointed.  2.  There is NO DVI input: I have a 4 year old MBP so I had to dig up the DVI to VGA converter and plug that in.  3.  The controls aren't super intuitive.  4.  Purely cosmetic, but there's alot of extra 'stuff' on the front of the monitor saying what it is ALL the time i.e. LED, HDMI, 1080p Full HD...But, as for what a monitor is supposed to do... Display stuff... This thing rocks.  I have a much more expensive (but older) Dell monitor at work and I prefer this one.I don't know why there are two HDMI's and no DVI which is why this isn't a five star rating.  Apparently it is MY fault my 'ancient' 2007 Macbook Pro failed to come with an HDMI port.  Weird.Anyway, for around two hundo this thing is a strong buy.",2,2,0.00095360866,0.0061457814,0.9929006

"Hit the lottery unlike the negative reviewers here who lost said lottery and rate Amazon and not the product. Got the TV delivered 20 min ago. Here's my short but VERIFIED review:1. TV has 0 branding on the front. I could slap a Samsung sticker on it if I wanted to.2. The TV actually has the power outlet pointed downwards which I wondered why my last 5 TV's decided to still have it pointing out the back.3. The remote looks bad but works. Who cares.4. The sound isn't that bad like everyone complains about. No vibration like someone else said. Plus, anyone who buys a 40""+ tv and plans on using built in sound vs a home theater is crazy. Unless it's a tv that is going in a play room.5. Picture looks fine to me.6. The stand seems sturdy, the screws that go into it though strip easy so be careful =)7. HDMI inputs are on the side of the tv and are tight. Meaning, a normal HDMI head fits flush up against the tv. So if you have a cable with the big black ferrite connector close to the top, it's going to be tight.8. The TV's interface menu is quick and is laid out well if that matters.For my first off brand tv, this was a steal and I am very happy with it.",2,2,0.091036886,0.10658585,0.8023773

"Ok, let's get one thing out of the way right now. This controller will not replace a Logitech Harmony. What it will do though is pretty alright.I purchased this controller/IR combo because it was cheap, and had all the components necessary to control a Raspberry Pi running XBMC. This package does serve that purpose fairly well.Most of the buttons do perform the task you would assume them to, but with a little but of digging I was able to get all but two or three working the way I want with keyboard mappings in XBMC itself. That does leave a couple buttons that I can't get working - two buttons register the same  on my Pi, even though they are sending different commands, and one or two just don't send anything that the Pi/XBMC recognize, but overall I'm satisfied.Physical attributes: the buttons are not the most pleasant to press. The wind up USB/IR receiver is pretty cool. Long when you need it, short when you don't.Overall I would recommend this set if you're on a real tight budget. There are definitely better sets out there, but this is good enough for me.",2,2,0.019658377,0.45054334,0.52979827

"Not exactly ""home theatre"" but an honest well made product.I bought these for ourToshiba 19LV610U 19-Inch 720p LCD TV with Built in DVD Player, Blackwhich we also bought from Amazon. Before I bought the TV, I knew from the reviews that its built-in amp was very weak and its speakers were, basically, rubbish.Everything else about the TV was fine so I bought it anyway and then bought these speakers. Using our X-140's, the TV sound more than fills our (small) living room. We are using broadcast signals only so we hardly have ""Dolby-sound"" or anything like that. Given our input signal limitations, these speakers are more than up to the job.These speakers plug into 120VAC with a regular 2 prong polarized plug, not a ""wall-wart"" transformer, used with other amplified speakers. I didn't know this when I bought 'em but I appreciate this feature now. The power cord is hard-wired, not detachable.With a DVD, the limitations of the X-140's are more apparent but since we have nothing better with which to compare them, we are mostly content.If we were listening to better quality audio input, I might consider upgrading to fancier speakers. I have heard Logitech makes those as well.Logitech Compact Speaker System Z320 for Notebooks, among many others.I sometimes play opera DVD's on my laptop & the X-140's are OK for that as well.

"I doubt I have ever had as much indecision in arriving at what I consider to be the most appropriate star rating for any item I've reviewed.  I do not claim to be a networking savant however I do have enough of a background that I felt confident that I could create a security-enabled network with only a moderate degree of frustration. And, if I thought through the process, I could have, but that blurb on the box about easy setup lured me in. Step one to achieving that objective would have been to dispense with any attempt to find documentation and then setting aside the resource CD.  Even if you are acquainted with networking, just call technical support from the outset, endure the requisite hold time and allow the support personnel to walk you through the installation. Yes, telephone support is outsourced to India however my impression is in this instance they are quite helpful, probably from plenty of practice.The 834B employs 802.11n draft standards and is backwards compatible with 802.11b and 802.11g as well as Ethernet connectivity. My installation utilizes ""g"" and Ethernet. Marketing documents claims include transmission speeds of up to 270Mbps and accommodation of security protocols WEP, WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK.  For some devices, security may be constrained to the base standard of WEP due to connectivity and wish I had known that before I started. In any event, with the protocol I finally ended up with, a passphrase of between 8-63 characters is required and clear definition of with security key to be used must be designated at Netgear's router configuration site. Obviously, one also has to select a network name, define a channel and hope for the best.  And then do it all over again when that channel fails to be recognized and you are locked into local connectivity only. It's likely that you will have to go through search and seek scenario three times before success in realized, assuming the chosen security option is valid, the passphrase is correctly constructed and all of your devices are supported. The ""Smart Wizard"" interface from the CD will get you the site but from there you're pretty much on your own and the site itself is not very intuitive.  So, as mentioned above, unless you are familiar with all of the nuances, sublimate the ego and just make the call. For me, the time I would have saved outweighs the satisfaction of completing the installation without assistance.My ambiguity on the rating is predicated my experience in getting the network up and running.  Thus far (3 months), I couldn't be more pleased with the hardware.  I rate it 5 stars. I do not encounter any significant episodes of signal loss, line drops or disconnects.  I have two PCs communicating via 3rd party wireless adapters and another linked by Ethernet to a Netgear access point/Bridge.  For the same reason, I can't accurately estimate the broadcast range of the router exclusively, but for those who might be interested, theNETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111)is impressive AND, easy to install on an existing network.  The documentation and support material resident on the CD is near to worthless, I rate it ""1"" star because ""0"" is not an option.  Customer Technical support rates ""3"" stars as the technicians seem to know their stuff but you will spend more than a few minutes on hold. So, I end up with an overall rating of ""4"" since in my view, the reliability of the hardware is the primary concern.",2,2,0.0040753623,0.02723522,0.9686894

"I'm an IT professional / gadget person and have worked with many other webcams over the years (mostly from Linksys).  Speaking from experience with getting webcams to work from the home, you just almost need a PhD (or have me for a son) to get these things working reliably.  You have to understand arcane things like port forwarding, be able to monkey around with DNS port forwarding on websites that often charge a fee, and make ""advanced"" changes to your router - just to get a single basic webcam working so you can view things remotely.  A few months ago I got a new home security system from [...] (who also sells on Amazon) and had my first experience with this powerline adapter technology - where IP signals are carried through your home's electrical system instead of wirelessly.  It worked really well - and on a whim, I decided to try this D-Link starter kit.  While very basic, it is by far the easiest system I've seen to setup and install - I was up-and-running in about 10 minutes.  Their d-life website completely takes the DNS hassle out of this and handles everything behind the scenes.  I would recommend this package to my 65 year old mother - who could easily figure this out without my help .  I read many of the reviews on this site for this product - I really can't imagine why anyone would have problems with this.  It's very entry-level and basic - so you can't expect too much.  Sure I'd like to have a full PTZ (pan / tilt / zoom) camera, be able to view for longer than 120 seconds, and have more control over the camera in general - but this package is very good for what it is.  The ONLY problem I had is that my home is on 2 different electrical panels(we had a large addition done - seperate panel) and one side of my house is basically invisable to the D-link ""server"", since it's next to my router on the other side of the house.  Otherwise - it works great.  Remember the D-Life service is free - they don't do a very good job of explaining that.",2,2,0.014783664,0.029886229,0.9553302

"After using the MR3040 for 2 weeks and then looking at some of the reviews I think I understand why the reviews are so mixed.The MR3040 is a very stylish well built unit almost like an Apple product, the only flimsy part may be the battery cover but that only needs to be opened if the rechargeable battery dies so I figure the three retaining clips should be good for years.The first complaint I see is battery life.  Yes you will get 5 Hours from the unit if you use it plugged into a LAN cable like a regular router.  If you use it on a 3g/4g wireless Dongle you will see that performance drop in half because the dongle is sucking up just as much power as the 3040 by itself.  So TP-Link was not lying it will work for 5 hours but they really should have stated that it depends on what you have plugged into the USB port.The second complaint I see is about setting up the unit.  I plugged my 4G dongle into my computer and it took about 20 minutes to get that working by itself, I had to find my cell phone companies APN etc.  I then plugged in the MR3040 and that took about 10 minutes to setup.  All I needed to do was make a few normal settings just like any router.  If you have ever setup a netgear router or any other basic home router then you will have no problems with the 3040.  I think the only setting I changed was the DNS server and the security passwords.  I am pretty sure it would have worked without changing anything.  So some people will probably be able to get this working without doing anything other than plugging it in.About my only gripe with the unit is that they should try to integrated a 3g/4g module directly into the 3040 because the external dongle for cell service makes the whole contraption awkward.You should also note that there is a 5 wireless connection limit on the unit, but needing more than 5 people sharing your router would be unlikely.The Power Button is placed in a vey awkward position, it's too recessed and requires the edge of you finger nail to turn it on or off.Charge time is about 5 hours through the adapter and i would imagine about 12 hours if you used a PC.It handles Type n connections and has most of the features like a full size router, you can check their website and download the manual for more info.I like the MR3040 because it allows me to have wifi within my Van and that's a good thing for people with Kids or people who own tablets or laptops.",2,2,0.05813433,0.37140888,0.57045686

"If you are in the market for a tablet you should seriously consider the xoom. It is faster and packed with more features compared to the ipad. Don't waste your money on apple's shiny piece of plastic. The xoom is faster,larger screen, gorilla glass(scratch resistant) , chrome browser is fast and you can open tabs and also browse in incognito mode(aka private browsing) , tons of free apps in the Android market.Set up is a breeze, just sign in with your gmail account. All your contacts, email, calendar automatically sync once you sign in. You need to use a credit card only if you make any purchase on Android market.  You will get all the Google goodness. To improve performance turn off animations. Settings->display ->animations. The only difference between ipad and the xoom is,the xoom cannot play Netflix. Netflix does not have an app for Android yet because of DRM. I don't care much for Netflix because I use Amazon instant video which plays flawlessly on the xoom. The Xoom more than makes up for the lack of Netflix by supporting flash. There are a ton of flash based videos and games that I would prefer to watch, but ipad does not (and will not) support flash. So, I will pick the ability to play flash over ablity to play Netflix.update: Facebook app force closes all the time. This is not Andriod Honeycomb or Xoom problem I think the Facebook app is not optimized for tablets. There are a handful of apps that are really optimized for the tablet. This is where Ipads win over Andriod. If Google wants Andriod to be successful they need to force app developers to optimize their apps for the right device.

I was able to mount it behind a trunk panel, making it completely hidden, Not many amps are able to fit there let alone perform. The next great thing about this amp is its sound quality.

"I had been in the market for a tripod for a while now. I've recently just gotten back into photography and needed a replacement for my broken Manfrotto tripod that had some broken clips on the legs.Well, for Christmas I got a $75 Amazon gift card and I said why not? I did some research and came across this gem. I'm a tall person at 6'5&#34;, so having a tall tripod is very important to me. This Dolica tripod comes in at an awesome 73-inches and is plenty tall.The leveling bubbles are a great bonus as well. I did a shoot a few weeks ago in Tent Rocks, New Mexico and it is all uneven ground in the slot canyon. With the levels, I was able to level my camera perfectly each and every time I moved my setup. And the spiked feet came in hand too.The foot that screws to the bottom of your camera is wonderful. Once on, it's a cinch to snap back onto your tripod or remove again. My second favorite feature however are how the legs completely splay outward. This is a unique feature many tripods do not have. It's like having a much shorter tripod built in already. Just flip up the little tabs at the tops of the legs and the legs can be folded outwards almost completely. Now we can get creative!I recommend this tripod to anyone who needs a professional quality tripod at a fraction of the pro price. It is well built, sturdy and will take a beating to boot! By the way, it is a little heavy, for those into ultra light-backpacking, but does strap nicely to a camera bag.",2,2,0.0013973396,0.003510179,0.9950924

"I've been using this keyboard for about two and a half weeks now, and I've been thrilled with it.PROS: If you don't need a number pad (or if you use a left-hand gaming pad), the size of this keyboard is preferable, and for me, where other keyboards would balk at working on my PS/2 port on my very new motherboard, this one worked perfectly. Also, where some people might not like the fact that the key descriptions are on the front of the key and not the top, I think this is a brilliant idea to help control the fact that these typically wear off with heavy use, and would certainly wear off before you hit the rated number of hits for a key.I went with the Cherry MX Green switches. They're about $20-$30 more expensive in general, but for me, it was the right mix between having a clicky keyboard, and having some added key resistance so that I don't constantly bottom out the keys. A lot of people might be put off by that price difference but if the need for a click fits your style, I think it's really worth it.CONS: The only major con that I can think of with this keyboard, and it's a stretch, is that the cord holders on the underneath side of the keyboard do not do a great job of holding the cord in place. It's not a deal breaker in any way shape or form, but a minor design flaw they can tweak on future revisions. It's not anything that would cause you to not buy this, but just something to be aware of.Would buy this keyboard again in a heartbeat, it's a premium model for sure, but if you're on the fence about what mechanical keyboard to get, this one's highly recommended.",2,2,0.0007760266,0.0016360283,0.9975879

"This switch works great. I no longer have to mess with the TV's source selection. What ever device I turn on to use is the device that feeds the TV. Couldn't be simpler!I first got acquainted with these switches when I needed to hook up a VCR, DVR, and a satelite box to an older TV that only had RF input. Phillips has a similar model of this switch that has an RF modulator built in. I have since bought a TV that also has composit, component, s-video, svga, and hgmi inputs. The switch worked so well, I retired the RF modulator version of this switch and got this one since I no longer needed the RF modulator.What the previous reviewer may not have noticed is that you cannot mix input modes on this switch so while it does soppurt HD to 720p it will only do so if all the devices hooked up to it provide component video output. S-Video might work but I don't know if it supports 720p or not, component video does. For 1080i or 1080p I beilieve you have to use HDMI connections which this switch does not support.

The music player does fine. I've got several audiobooks (mp3 format, haven't tried WMA audiobooks yet) from the library on the device, and like how it remembers where you are, even if you switch to the radio/music/etc. for a while or turn it off. The FF and reverse functionality are also nicely scaled, meaning that the longer you hold the button down, the faster the device scrolls through the song/chapter/etc. (And an indicator on the display shows you exactly where you are.)Overall, very pleased.

"If you are willing to set reasonable expectations from a laptop, then the Toshiba A215-s7437 is a great value.  I picked mine up on sale for $699 and at that price it was a real bargain.  Obvious pros: generous 2GB RAM, spacious 200GB hard drive (albeit with a slower 4200 rpm speed, but it doesn't seem to slow things down much), Turion dual core processor.  Not so obvious pros: great screen, good speakers.  Many laptops these days are overly reflective and make extended work sessions hard on the eyes, but not so with the Toshiba and its nice, clear display that doesn't overdo the reflective glare.  The speakers are very clean and crisp and while they won't provide any major bass response they sound good and don't disintegrate into distortion madness if you turn them up.So far I haven't run into any performance glitches.  I've read complaints of buggy power-down modes, but I've tried out sleep and hibernate with the computer set in low, mid, and high power management modes without any problems.  The wireless adapter has worked flawlessly both at home and at work without any interruptions.  Haven't tried out the CD/DVD burner yet but don't foresee any problems (I'll edit the review if I discover any!).On the negative side the unit is pre-loaded with a fair amount of bloatware, but so are almost all the rest of the new laptops these days and it is easy enough to remove.  Like most other laptops in this price range, the included Microsoft Office Suite is a trial only, so expect to pay for it or use an alternative such as the really nice free app OpenOffice.  Finally, the battery life isn't stellar if you're a road warrior doing extended sessions without power.  In low power mode I got a little over 2 hours of web surfing before it conked out.  This would probably be even shorter if you watch DVDs, so keep this in mind.By the way, other reviews have mentioned strange pixelated lines at the top of the screen.  This is not a problem, it is part of a Toshiba loaded program called ""Flash Cards.""  Scroll your cursor up to these lines and icons slide down to adjust various settings (screen brightness, power mode, etc).  If it bothers you, you can easily turn the program off within the Start menu.Overall this is a great laptop for work and casual home use.  If you want a competitively priced and competitively featured laptop that is also reliable and performs well for standard tasks like web surfing, office productivity, and consumer multimedia use then I can't find any reason not to check out the Toshiba A215-s7437.",2,2,0.0004586428,0.0018887189,0.9976527
"First and foremost is the sound quality since that is what anyone looking at getting the beast wants to know. I am not an audiophile as I prefer sound with a deeper punch and I can tell you that if you fall into the same category their is not a better option for a portable iPod/Phone speaker. With the EQ you have the option to tone down the house shaking bass, but if you prefer for things on a softer side then look elsewhere. The sound emitted from this thing is definitely a 5/5. Some may disagree, but I am a fan of the combo style of new age with retro combination and the build quality is excellent.

"I am a previous lover of Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds, but I'm never going back, as long as these Coby's turn out to last a long time.  The Ink'd earbuds only last about 5 or 6 months, which is a long time...but not when you're spending that much, I don't think. They are very effective at blocking out sound, so good that I have to keep taking them out of my ears to make sure my mom or siblings aren't calling for me.  But if you don't mind periodically taking them out of your ears to check if you're missing anything, then these are great headphones!  They are super comfortable, too.  Others make your ear itch or sore, but these fit in just as far as they need to to be effective, no more.  And the one-size-fits-all rubber tip is great, because it's glued in so that you can't accidentally knock it off, like I do with other earbuds.Plus, for 5.00's are you going to find a better deal?

"This is an excellent webcam for the price.  It does not, however, live up to its hype.  For example, it does not directly support iMovie.

It also said that the webcam could take 8.0 MP images (1706x1280) -- but it doesn't mention that, to do this, you need to take around 10 frames with little motion and then combine them using a program such as PhotoAcute ([...]).

The microphone is quite good (if you're using this for videoconferencing).  And, despite my complaints, this camera (not counting software) compares well to small video cameras costing four times as much.  It's really beyond the webcam category; how many people videoconference from a 30-inch monitor?  (The native resolution is too high for a 23-inch monitor, part of the window falls off the screen.)  It just barely misses by not having access to good software that can control it using modern (Intel) Macs.",2,2,0.0026206814,0.03856535,0.95881397

"OBJECTIVE / EXECUTIONI wanted to convert my collection of old, bulky, misshapen flash drives into something more compact and versatile.  This little device seemed like the perfect solution.  I bought 3 or 4 considerable-capacity MicroSD cards and this card reader ; now I have a 'very' lightweight and flexible solution.PROS1. My favorite part is how the MicroSD cards just slide so perfectly in where the little USB plastic ""stopper"" usually is.  Ingenious.2. It's so small that it NEVER intrudes into the physical space of a nearby USB port (as sometimes is the case, with other flash devices, on computers where the USB ports are very close to one another).3. The reader has a blue activity light inside its translucent casing.  Totally didn't expect that (from looking at the stock photos), but a very welcome surprise.4. Performance is top-notch.  I haven't done any data x-fer benchmarks, but it seems just as fast as any other USB flash-based solution I've ever used.  Unless you happen to have some critical need for extremely fast data x-fers, I can't imagine you being disappointed.  Of course, if that's the case, you're probably going to be using something besides USB 2.0.CONSNone.  At least that I've found.

"After quite a bit of research over several weeks I chose to purchase this B+W filter.  Probably the most influential article I read was on Lenstip.com.  The article may be somewhat dated (2009), but the depth and concise nature of the article convinced me this filter was top-drawer.  The only higher rated filter was the Hoya, but after reading some negative reviews pertaining to quality control or possibly &#34;bait and switch&#34; problems, I went with the B+W.This filter is obviously a high quality product from the minute you pick it up.  Build quality is exceptional and I was truly amazed by the  clarity of the glass itself.  I had to angle the filter in several orientations to see the glass at all.  At first glance it's hard to tell there is anything inside the outside ring!Of course the main purpose of this filter is to enhance your photographs.  I am not a professional photographer so I don't have experience with other high-end UV filters, but based on the comparison photographs taken with other top-rated filters, the B+W had an obvious reduced amount of added flare (if any).  Personal preference might direct someone to desire some flare from a filter, but I personally did not want this &#34;effect&#34;.After using the filter for more than a month now it never comes off of my Nikon 18-55mm DX VR lens.  This is my go-to lens for my Nikon D90 and my go-to filter.  Basically, I never take it off the lens unless I want to shoot with my B+W CPL polarizer filter by itself.  What I notice mostly is that the colors and clarity of the shots I have been taking are phenomenal.My Grandfather was a professional photographer since the '30s and I have been taking pictures from the late '60s.  I have used very high end cameras, lenses and filters over the years and sometimes the pictures are exceptional with the right combination of equipment and overall conditions.It might be excessive to imagine spending $40 or $50 dollars on a UV filter compared to some for $10 dollars or less.  But, I have to say that with my Nikon D90 and a relatively cheap &#34;kit&#34; 18-55mm lens, MOST of the pictures I now take are exceptional.  I have rarely seen this level of quality in photographs on a regular basis.Just to note, I use this 72mm filter with a Goja 52mm to 72mm adapter ring.(another very high quality product for the $3.99 price).",2,2,0.0010315413,0.0015636295,0.99740475

"We were considering replacing our older Panasonic CRT 47"" 1080i rear projection TV, but it was working fine......until Friday night!! The TV kicked the bucket, so we went out looking & read some reviews here on Amazon for various DLP's, Plasmas & LCD's. I wanted something larger than 55"" and in 1080p. After looking at several TVs (plasma & LCDs) we kept going back to this Mitsubishi WD-60737....it just had an amazing picture! As luck would have it, a local retailer had it on SALE for $995.00!! WOW! We bought the Mitsubishi DLP, a Panasonic Blu-Ray player and TV stand all for under $1,500.00!!Once we got it home and out of the box, we played SD cable channels (these actually looked better than expected, we were impressed that the stations did NOT look grainy) and HD cable channels (absolutely stunning.....HD Nascar & HD baseball was breath-taking). Once we had the Panasonic Blu-Ray player up and running, we watched various DVDs that we rented from the movie store. wow, WOW. We couldn't believe our eyes!! The Disney-Pixar movies looked stunning, we watched TAKEN and it was AWESOME.Honestly, there are NO faults with this DLP. We wanted to get the 65"" version, but it was just a little too big for our living room. The 60"" is PERFECT for us. The features on this TV are endless, the picture is darn near perfect ""out of the box"", Blu-Ray makes this DLP TV really SHINE!!This TV is awesome, no complaints (how could you complain getting one for $995??).

"Shipping was slower than the other ipod items I ordered. It arrived after the ipod, the screen protectors, and the car charger. However, it was within the window that Amazon allows. I mention it because the back of the ipod already had scratches on it even though I only used it for two days and put it into a pocket in my purse.The case is a nice snug fit and feels good in the hand. It covers the back and overlaps the top corners, protecting them and covering the edges of the screen protector. All the holes lined up correctly, and I had no difficulty plugging in the sync cable or headphones. The on/off and volume buttons are not cut out, but it is not difficult to depress them.

"I was surprised to find such a quality product. The plastic film sticks very well to my Lumix DMC-ZS3 and it is a perfect fit.It is a bit tricky to put the protector onto the camera screen because one teensy speck of dust will cause a bubble, and you cannot get the speck off without washing the sheet. Even though I used great care, two specks got under the plastic and formed two bubbles, I don't know why the bubbles are so much bigger than the specks. I felt I probably did the best I could since the static sucked the dust specks to the plastic sheet. I left the two small bubbles and they don't really bother me. Of course, if you are Type A, obsessive-compulsive, or a perfectionist, they would drive you nuts and you would probably wash the sheet and go into a sterilize room to re-apply the plastic, and you would probably be able to do a much better job than me.The directions are clear and helpful, and it does say you can wash and reuse the sheet--which is a plus.I just wish that for this price, you should get two protectors.

"So the pros first:  This system gives the user HUGE flexibility when it comes to configuration.  When I ordered it, I had planned on using the speakers as a sound bar in front of the TV, and then hiding the subwoofer behind our couch.  Alas, after assembling the speakers into the soundbar - I realized it was far too long.  So - followed the instructions to set them up as seen in this main picture.  Trying to keep the TV area uncluttered, I hid the speakers behind the screen, but ended up having to move them as that really diminished the sound quality.  There are also wall mount options - an incredible number of combinations without making assembly too complicated.Cons: There is the weirdest thing going on.  The system includes 2 power cords, which are interchangable between the controller box and the subwoofer.  I keep having to switch the cords between the two, because every so often, the controller box will lost power.  Switch the cords and then both devices work again.  I cannot figure this out, but if it continues, I will need to contact customer service.The overall sound is very good - but I think I will only use this when watching movies.  With regular TV shows, the dialogue is a weird combination of tinny and echoey.  I've tried all the settings, but can't seem to imrpove the quality of the spoken word.  With movies, however, and in Stereo mode, you get that movie theater richness of sound.Anyway - I like the system and will keep trying to figure out the power issue - but for now - movie night just got a lot louder.",2,2,0.03358637,0.29033095,0.6760826

"So far, so good.  This TV is an upgrade from a 40-inch 720p Samsung LCD that died last week.  My first impression was that the Sony was much more elegant and minimalist in design.  This is not surprising -- the trend is to thinner TV's and LED's especially so.  Even though the screen is 10 inches bigger, the overall case of the TV was not all that much larger than the older Samsung.  The ""frame"" around the screen is thinner than the old TV.  It's a very nice design that looks great on the wall.  Very easy to mount on my existing wall mounting bracket.The menus could stand to be a little more intuitive.  There are several ways to access the same function, which may not be a bad thing, but can leave me feeling like I'm going in circles when I explore for new features and end up at the menu I just left.Picture is very nice.  I am not a real-deal videophile, so I don't speak the real language of a TV reviewer on this front, but I am very observant and pretty picky about the picture.  My overall impression is that the Samsung was just somehow brighter than this TV.  Especially when playing BluRay's in Cinema mode, I found myself searching for ways to brighten the picture.  Cinema mode itself does not seem to offer any way to make color or brightness adjustments, and the only option is to change from Cinema mode to ""Standard"" or ""Automatic.""  Both of these kick in the 240 response rate and smoothing effects, which gives the movie the soap opera effect -- yuck.  The solution I found was to go to the BluRay player itself and set it to its ""bright room"" setting.  This added the brightness I wanted in Cinema mode and made the picture absolutely beautiful.  Honestly, after that slight adjustment, I have been pretty giddy about how beautiful the picture is playing BluRay movies.The picture when TV viewing is very nice.  The TV has an option to view in standard or ""Vibrant"" mode.  Vibrant mode is brighter, but just seems to over-saturate the colors, so I have kept to standard for most everything.  Again, it's a little less bright than the Samsung and the picture seems a little softer, but that's growing on me.  The motion smoothing effects seem to work well for regular TV viewing.  I have not yet watched any sports, so I will see what I think after watching a college bowl game tonight.  The picture on Netflix needed adjusting because of the soap opera effect, but that was easy enough to fix by turning off some of the bells and whistles in the picture menu.Smart TV features are a mixed bag.  I hard wired the connection with a network cable to my router, so the wireless issues some have mentioned are not an issue for me.  (If possible, get a long network cable, chase it through the attic, drop it to your router.  You'll be happier with the streaming.)  The Sony Entertainment Network menu is easy to navigate and streams Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu Plus, YouTube, and Pandora, along with many, many others I had never heard of.  I was pretty familiar with all of these from my Sony BluRay player, so no surprises here.  The menu is easy to navigate and it all works well.  The Yahoo apps and widgets, on the other hand, are a nightmare.  Maybe I will figure these out eventually, but now all I can say is, ""huh?"".  Truly not intuitive.The remote is fine -- no frills and easy to use.  The dedicated Netflix button on the remote is kind of cool -- my kids really like it.  As a bonus, it operates the basic features of my Sony BluRay player, so it has cut down on our ""find the remotes"" angst.  It really could use a qwerty keyboard or access to the iPhone remote app.  Come on, Sony.  Is that to much to ask?Sound is really pretty good.  I almost always run the sound through my receiver and surround speakers by means of an optical out cable, but when I have used the TV sound, it has been fine.  No reservations on this front.In all, I love it.  I think I will learn a few more nuances of its operation over the next week or so, and I expect that this will only help me love it more.  I wish I had known I would need this on Black Friday weekend and could have saved a couple hundred bucks, but such is life.  This is a great TV.",2,2,0.0009778454,0.004490171,0.994532
"I purchased this camera a year ago, for my wife's birthday.  I decided to wait a while before writing a review until we had a chance to use it in every possible situation in order to arrive at a useful conclusion for this review.  I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer, and I shoot with my Nikon DSLR most of the time, but I have to say that the Lumix TZ5 is one of the finest point and shoot digicams I have ever had the pleasure of using.  In some cases, it even out performs my Nikon D80.  Though I will not be trading in my D80 any time soon, this camera can hang with the best of them, if you are concerned with image quality.  Just take a look at all of the sample shots on the product page, if you need convincing.So, now on to my review.Image quality -I have found the image quality to be above average outdoors under bright, sun-lit conditions as well as overcast conditions, handling exposure perfectly while in the intelligent auto mode.  Up to ISO 200, the images are very crisp and clean, with almost zero hint of noise, even in the shadows.  But as with most point and shoot digital cameras these days, it begins to suffer from the most annoying type of noise (chroma), beyond ISO 400, even outdoors.  Shooting indoors, without flash, over ISO 400 and you almost shouldn't bother, if you're looking for super crisp images.  However, it does provide images that are quite usable in many of the trick scene modes.  Also indoors, shooting in mixed light, I have found that the TZ5 has trouble chosing the correct white balance while in intelligent auto mode.  I found myself changing the preset on my own to suit the conditions.  This is fine for people who know what white balance is, but not so for those like my wife, for whom this particular camera was intended.  And it really suffers under incandescent (or halogen) lighting, tending more toward a very unattractive orange cast.  But believe it or not, while shooting in intelligent auto mode, if you take several frames under such light, the camera will begin to ""figure it out"" and you may get one good frame out of perhaps three or four.  I thought that to be as good as I've seen in a digital camera (my nikon included).  It tends to hunt for focus indoors a lot, rendering the face detection auto-focus somewhat useless as it will find it very hard to find my 7 year old's face 5 feet from the lens, despite the AF assist lamp.  But outdoors, it's right on the money.Resolution -The 9.1 megapixels of this camera has plenty resolution for 8x12"" prints at 300 dpi, which is how I determine the usefulness of the number of pixels it has.  At half the resolution, it will produce a print much larger with enough quality given a lack of noise, so if you take a shot outdoors, using a low ISO, you can expect VERY nice prints from this camera.  Some of the new models of this year, boasting 14 mp or higher, don't tend to appeal to me as much as they are marketed to have better ""quality"" because I know better.  So don't be tricked by the number of pixels these cameras have.Optics -This camera has some of the finest optics I have used in a point and shoot digicam.  The 10x zoom of this camera is supurb, the image stabilization compliments the long end of the focal length quite nicely and works well in either mode you have it set to, though I prefer mode 2 (which activates the stabilization at capture - saving the battery).  Even the ""extra"" zoom function works quite well if you can hold noise at bay.  I really can't say enough about this camera's image stabilizer.  This feature makes taking images so much more easy as you don't have to feel tenced while waiting for the camera to ""take"".  I see no optical aberrations, and it has a very lovely, if not slightly more saturated color reproduction.Movie mode -I have not yet found much use for this feature, at the maximum settings, you can't record beyond 12 minutes (or so) for a single clip (which I imagine is quite good anyway), on a 4 GB SDHC card.  But the video I have recorded is good for what it came from, the sound may leave more to be desired, though.Fit, form, and function -This camera has a very solid feel in the hands (or hand, for we large handed folk).  It's outer case is some form of aluminum, and has a nice matte finish.  The bit of rubber on the grip is nice, and helps make this camera very comfortable to shoot with casually.  The controls are easy to figure out and all where they need to be.  The laymen photographer would likely benefit from a quick glance at the owner's manual to familiarize themselves with some of the more advanced functions, but I think most would take to the understanding on their own quite easily.  The rear LCD screen is a very nice size and has great resolution and works quite well when reviewing and zooming in on images captured.  And the battery life is decent, good for a full day out and about.  One thing I would like to mention is that, as mentioned earlier, I use mode 2 for the image stabilizer and I shoot at medium resolution (5-6 mp) quite often and enjoy long battery life.  You may need to play around with different image quality and resolution settings to find your sweet spot.  I prefer the JPEG-fine quality setting at medium resolution, which gives me more space on my 4 GB SDHC card (approx. 1200 shots per card)I originally bought this camera for my wife, to replace her aging 6 mp fuji finepix series point and shooter.  In the beginning, she didn't find much use for it, leaving it for me to play with for a while and I loved it.  In the last six months however, she has started to use it to do product shots for her handmade jewelry and accessories business she does and she absolutely loves it.  She gets more compliments on how good the images of her products are than offers to buy them.  Gotta love that tough economy, and you also gotta love this camera.  Allaround, it's a great camera at a much cheaper price than I paid last year, brand new -- and a very stylish look and feel as well (we got the blue one).  So get one while you can.  It's super nice if you've got a lot of light, but suffers greatly as light diminishes.  In situations like that, I recommend taking it out of iA mode, selecting a lower ISO, and letting the image stabilizer work for you.  You'll tend to get much better results.",2,2,0.001204765,0.002675673,0.9961195

"Just bear in mind that this cable uses a screen instead of a foil for a outer shield.  Screens work well but are a little trickier to install properly when terminating.  Each twisted pair uses a nice heavy foil shield though.  The wires themselves only have solid color codes too but that is OK because of the way they've been separated by the shields which makes it difficult to mix them up.The other thing to note is that this cable is extra flexible, at least compared to other CAT6A wiring, due to the lack of a inner separator which most CAT6A wires use to keep the twisted pairs tightly wrapped around each other.  This wasn't a problem and actually made installation easier but I felt should be noted.The spool was well made but the shipper beat the crap out of the box so the edges got a bit pulverized.  Still worked fine so I don't care.For the price I paid at the time (around $250) this was a great deal.

"I've been using this lens for just over a week, and so far I'm extremely happy with it. I originally bought the Konica Minolta Maxxum 5D DLR with its 18-70mm kit lens, and then bought a 28-200mm zoom, hoping that would be my ""go everywhere"" lens, but I wound up really missing the extra wide angle range.This lens very effectively covers the range of both of these.Several reviewers have commented on how noisy the autofocus is, and also how slow it is. For me, not shooting sports or other fast action, this has not been a concern, nor is the noise. And considering the price, I'm not complaining.I've also read reviews about the level of distortion/pincushioning at various levels of zoom, and I have seen this stuff using this lens; however, so far, nothing that couldn't be fixed using the Correct Camera Distortion function in Photoshop Elements 8, which is a 4 year old program, so anything you can get now will probably handle it very well.All in all, I'm extremely happy with this lens; it's doing exactly what I want from it, and at a VERY reasonable price.**UPDATE 3/18/2013: At the time I bought this lens, about 2 months ago, Amazon had it priced $100 HIGHER ($299.00); it's now showing $199.00; I'M REALLY ANNOYED, but if you're thinking about this lens, NOW'S THE TIME!!!

"There are plenty of reviews out there, and I don't want to be redundant. So here are some helpful points that I had a hard time ferreting out when doing my research before pulling the trigger on this purchase, given that I was upgrading from a D60 and that I am, like many who are reading reviews on this product, not a professional:1. I owned the D40, then the D60. So this is my third Nikon. I had trouble deciphering how my lenses, purchased for the D40/D60, would behave when used in this new model. The answer is that the D90 handles all of them perfectly. This includes lenses that have the HSM built in (the Hyper Sonic Motor is packaged in the lens, because the D40/D60 range doesn't have a built in auto-focus motor) as well as those with no internal motor. The D90 has an internal focus motor, so all lenses built for Nikon cameras will auto-focus, including the Nikon 50mm f1.8 lens that I had to manually focus in the D60.2. The D90 is heavier, but certainly not uncomfortable to hold or carry. Weight will not be a discouraging factor in purchasing this camera.3. The D90 takes different batteries, so any spares you have for the earlier models will not work on it. Battery life is truly outstanding. I am not even going to buy a spare battery.4. The user interface is completely different from the D40/D60. I found it intuitive however. The functionality is just superb, much easier and more flexible. This is a pro level camera with the ease of use of a high end amateur camera.5. Live view is a great enhancement. Really.Overall, there is nothing I can say negative about the D90. It's everything I was hoping it would be, and it's so worth the money to upgrade. I'm selling the D60 for half what I paid - and doing it gladly - because the D90 is worth more than it's being sold for. I absolutely highly recommend it.I also thought I would offer some lens advice, because I had trouble finding a reviewer that just cut to the chase and said ""look, just do this."" So, look, just do this: I do NOT recommend the kit lenses that you can obtain bundled with the D90. Get the body only (Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)), and buy yourself that Nikon 50mm f1.8 (Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras). It's a no-brainer at the price point, and the images I have already achieved have been just excellent. For the rest of your lenses, I highly recommend Sigma. I own the 18-200 (Sigma 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DC Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras), the 10-20 (Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras), and the 150-500 (Sigma 150-500mm f/5-6.3 AF APO DG OS HSM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras). I cannot say enough positive things about the quality of the lenses or the images. Pack the 50mm and the 18-200 superlens for normal occasions. If you can stand the extra weight, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the 10-20 for landscapes, it just pulls in everything and the quality is shocking. The 150-500 is enormous, you are not going to want to carry that thing around, but when you need it, you really need it. I captured images of my son playing in a soccer game that blew me away; could not have gotten the shots without the big lens. Get the lenses in the order I have specified if you cannot afford them all.I have just learned all this over the past 2 years. I am no expert but I have discovered the joy of capturing great images that you just cannot get from a point-and-shoot. I think once you see the quality you can achieve with a better camera, you will be thrilled with the decision to spend the money and the energy. And Nikon has truly produced the best camera at this price point in the world. It's a pro camera with an amateur price and it's very easy to use. Words really don't do it justice; you need to experience it to understand.Any questions, please send me a comment. Happy to help!",2,2,0.0013038623,0.0029156986,0.99578047

"For about a year, I listened to my digital music collection via an ipod dock hooked up to my stereo receiver.  Then I splurged and bought this computer and hooked it up to the receiver with the digital optical connection.  As I understand it, this connection produces better sound than the ipod dock because it uses the receiver's DAC to process the digital signals (most ipod docks use the ipod's built-in DAC, which stinks).  The difference was obvious to me.  With this setup, the audio quality I get from my lossless files is comparable to a good cd player.  FYI, my receiver is a Harman Kardon HK3490.It's true that this machine stutters with netflix, but I think this is a silverlight problem.

"Did a lot of research on this one.I have four 10' poles for this from Radio Shack, it is cemented 2' into ground. And attached at the gable on my house 15' up.

It's about 3 foot tall, and the length and width of a full size Chevy Saburban.I've got this fed into a Grounding block, which runs into a 6' ground pole via a thick copper wire rated at 60,000 volts.

The preamp doesn't get you any more channels, it just ensures you don't lose any signal on the way to your TV from the pole.I suggest visiting [...] to figure out about how many channels you will get.I also suggest hooking up a tv right at the pole, so you can get it twisted to perfection right then and there.Lastly, I suggest you reinforce this thing, 3 times as much as you think, cause it's huge.",2,2,0.005868604,0.02354283,0.9705886

"I recieved this item for Christmas a few days ago and came on Amazon to read some reviews about it.  I was shocked at the low ratings especially at the price point this sells for.  I am a bit of an electronic junkie and for the price, which was 100 you cannot beat this item.One of my main concerns was the DVD upconverting as a I have a large DVD collection.  It took my old LOTR DVD's which were full screen format and made them look amazing, at least when comparing them to what they looked like through a standard DVD player.The blu ray play is great as well.  I have a 46 inch samsung LCD 1080p 120hz tv.  The player brings out the best of the tv's abilities.Downside... Yes it does not come with wi-fi capability included, and yes it is somewhat misleading that it says wi-fi ready on the box, however, I am an attorney and quickly read the fine print to realize what I was getting, a non wi-fi included unit.  I hardwired the unit so it was not a big deal.Other downside... The netflix software is crap when comparing it to what I can get on my xbox.  I truly asked for the machine solely for the blu ray and dvd upconverting, since I had an xbox for netflix. I was shocked at the difference in software quality between the two.Overall, great product and for the price does the job.  Would definitely recommend this product.",2,2,0.009445266,0.045931622,0.94462305

"I've been using my Neo since it first came out. That's a lot of years and probably a thousand free ebooks from Porject Gutenberg!The following is an old review I wrote and still holds true today:If You Have A Passion For Ebooks - especially the classics, there is no better ebook reader than the Visor Neo. As an avid publisher and reader, over the past years I've tried most handhelds available.The Handspring Visor Neo is the handheld hands down winner!Why?1. It runs on 2 AAA batteries. Experience has shown that, surprisingly, AAA battery power is overall the best way to go over the long term and very simple and hassle free.2. HotSynching with the USB cradle and Palm software is painless!3. Good screens. Since the Visor Neo is an updated version of the Visor Deluxe, it has a newer version of the Palm OS and better screen ... however, they are both excellent values for the money.4. Sorry PocketPC, but you just cannot beat the efficiency of the Palm Operating System. In the Palm doc format, huge books take up amazingly little space. The Visor Neo offers plenty of room as an ebook reader - especially if you don't care about using the other features (though they take up only a small space also).5. Use the Neo with the best freeware ebook reader, CSpotRun. (Forget Palm Reader).Years ago, Handspring sold to Palm. Then Palm blew it. They stopped offering the Visor handhelds. The absolute best handheld ebook reading device went out of production. However, there are, fortunately, still some of these great handhelds for sale. And, who knows, maybe Palm or someone else will finally wake up and bring these simple, no frills ebook readers back into production.",2,2,0.0034437801,0.0059578903,0.99059826

"This attractive-looking backpack is roomy, has comfortable adjustable shoulder straps and contains four compartments.  The compartment that sits closest to a backpacker's back is ""topped off"" by the shoulder straps (i.e., portions of the wide shoulder straps cover up part of the compartment's zippered top) and has room enough for a laptop with up to a 15.6 inch display (like my Asus laptop).  This compartment has very good padding, including the bottom, and has two zippers with big handles; one of the zippers opens all the way down to just four inches above the bottom, the other doesn't extend further than the shoulder -- a feature that I think gives the stored laptop a little bit of added protection by controlling the amount of space available for maneuvering the said laptop into and out of the backpack.To the front of this compartment is the roomier ""main"" compartment, which can also be used to store the above-mentioned laptop, but be aware that the bottom is not as well-padded as the previous compartment's bottom.  One ""wall"" of the main compartment comes with a good-sized zippered mesh pocket; the other ""wall"" contains two pockets: a small, zippered mesh pocket located at the top, and in the bottom is a padded pocket for storing an iPad or a similarly-sized tablet.  The main compartment has two zippers with big handles.Of the remaining two compartments, both of which are smaller than the previous two compartments, the bigger one has two zippers with big handles, a zippered pocket, and three smaller non-zippered pockets for pens and small devices, such as an iPod or a cell phone.The frontmost as well as the smallest compartment opens on the side, and its single zipper is tucked away from view.  Its dimensions are, roughly, 7.25 inches wide and 10 inches tall (so room enough for, say, a slim and medium-ish sized writing pad).The backpack has a nice styling and is well-constructed.

"I wrote a scathingly negative one-star review (see my other Amazon reviews) of the Roku 2 XS when it first became available here on Amazon.com in August 2011.My final comment after returning the, in my opinion, not ready for prime time Roku 2 XS was something to the effect that I would intentionally be waiting for Roku 3 before ever purchasing another Roku.Well Roku 3 is finally here and boy oh boy am I ever glad to have waited!Initial setup of this extremely compact streaming device is truly a breeze and takes just a few minutes.All of the annoying issues of interference with other devices (sound bar, digital picture frame, Internet radio, etc.) in my living room - in which absolutely nothing has changed since August 2011 when I took the Roku 2 XS for an extremely disappointing spin - have been completely resolved in this new incarnation of the Roku product line.Internet connection problems are no more even with the very same wireless router and modem that I had back in 2011: The Roku 3 connects quickly and easily to my private/secure WiFi network and streaming of the available channels (a truly overwhelming selection with hundreds of free channels and others at nominal monthly cost) is fast and smooth just like a conventional TV program not originating via the Internet. The audio signal is loud and crystal clear. As of 05/21/2013, I have an approximately 50 Mbps broadband download speed available, but 20 Mbps also has worked fine in the past.To avoid disappointment before purchasing any Roku model be sure to do your research concerning available programming/channels beforehand. Check the Roku Web site on the Internet to see what is and what is not available as far as channel selection is concerned, as well as what is absolutely free and which programming is associated with a clearly specified recurring monthly fee.Two sites on the Internet - Roku Guide and Roku Channel Database - also can provide extremely useful information on Roku programming, especially the lowdown on free private channels (such as BBC World News and others) and the needed codes to add them to your Roku device. As of 12/30/2013, I have 123 absolutely free channels installed on my Roku 3 and this includes YouTube which has just recently been added to the impressive lineup.Especially if you are news junkie, you will be able to get much more than your needed fix and possibly be at serious risk of overdosing from all the English language (and many foreign language) newscasts available from the USA and diverse international sources (UK, Japan, China, Australia, Canada, Russia, the entire EU - most notably Germany and France, Israel, South Africa and many others).I have read several reviews posted here on Amazon giving the Roku 3 a single star, because the purchaser's incorrect and unrealistic expectations were not met, namely being able to see everything live on all broadcast channels just like he/she could with cable/dish television but for free. Get real! Obviously these individuals did not properly research what this device does and does not do before purchasing it. They are the ones who have earned a one star rating, not the Roku 3!The remote control provided is simple to use and responds quickly when appropriate buttons indicating one's selections are actuated and it need not be pointed at the Roku 3.I haven't yet had occasion to use the provided earphones or try out the memory expansion capability with a microSD card, but I really don't expect any problems here.Overall, this is a very impressive example of technical virtuosity. The device is well worth the price of approximately $100.00 which for many people represents the monthly cost of cable/dish television. It may sound good to have potential access to 200-300 channels, but in reality you're probably really only interested in regularly watching a small percentage (10% ?) of what you're being forced to pay for in those inconvenient channel packages. With Roku 3 and other streaming devices channel selection is always a la carte.If you're a really smart consumer what you'll do is purchase one of these newly available game-changing Roku 3 streaming devices, pair it with a small and nifty indoor antenna like the Mohu Leaf or the Terk HDTVa Antenna Pro (see my reviews here on Amazon) to also receive TV channels the old fashioned and free way via the airwaves and then cut the cable company/dish cord for good.I have done this and have been cable-free since August 2011 and am loving it! You too can liberate yourself from cable company/dish slavery and save the cost of a brand new HDTV every year (about $1200.00 annually). Go ahead, cut the cord and finally set yourself free!Note that if you do decide to pursue a cable-free, dish-free TV lifestyle, don't skimp on the broadband connection that you will need to ensure smooth streaming with minimal buffering; this is especially important with a WiFi connection. Sufficient bandwidth is essential for the Roku 3 to provide an enjoyable TV viewing experience; it can't work miracles without it.",2,2,0.009131634,0.0090470575,0.98182136

Some users said it could be powered by the HDMI cable.It worked, but the synch was slightly off and I saw some color bars at the edge.

"So, I'm a techie and I own a small company that, for simplification, is a VAR and Systems Integrator. I'm also a Microsoft Partner, so I wasn't nearly as weirded out about Windows 8 as other users and reviewers. However, I had a Dell Inspiron that I spec'd out myself and purchased before working on a Presidential Campaign during the 2008 cycle that needed to be replaced. That older notebook was Windows 7 Professional and it had been a work horse for sooooo long, that I *hated* the idea of changing horses.My first impressions of this notebook are &#34;good&#34; and I feel that it was made well and the features, as promised, meet the expectations. The touchscreen is VERY responsive and works well. The display is bright and crisp... and the resolution is as expected. I AM NOT a big fan of the keyboard, but my muscle-memory for typing will change and I'll get more proficient. (I can say that a ton of vendors have gone to / reverted to this &#34;chicklet&#34; style of keyboard and it takes quite a while to get up to speed with them if you are used to a more traditional spacing and layout.)The system installed RAM is adequate at 4GB, but if you do development in Visual Studio or GameMaker or anything like that, plan on upgrading AT LEAST to 8GB. I've verified with other owners that this machine does take up to 16GB RAM when using 2 8GB DDR3L modules. I have ordered the upgrades and will update this post when I do so.One thing to consider is that the hard drive is a 500GB 5400 RPM drive... I will need to upgrade this to 1TB and will also report back on any performance gain acquired by going to 7200 RPM.On another note, I can't stress how relieved I am that the touchpad is not quirky nor error-prone like the ones on similarly priced notebooks from Toshiba or HP. I've already worked on these brands for clients and I can tell you that in Windows 8, having a crappy touchpad really, really screws you. This machine exhibits NONE of that behavior and the touchpad is luckily reliable and responsive!So far, this machine has taken everything I've thrown at it and with a few typical tweaks, I'll be a totally happy camper.",2,2,0.0010945217,0.0059072054,0.99299824

"I have the Garmin n&uuml;vi 780 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with MSN Direct Serviceand was glad to acquire the 285WT as well. I could talk about the side by side comparison of features between the two, but the chart on this page identifies them for you already. What I want to share with you is something that I consider to be very important, and I don't notice many covering it, and that is the sound experience. When I am driving down the highway, first and foremost on my wish list is to be enjoying the radio or CD. Having automated directions is just as important, but not at the cost of not being able to listen to music. The 780 which sells currently for around the same amount of money as the 285WT is a full featured premium version including the MP3 playback feature, whereas the 285WT does not. Both units accept the SDHC cards with the latest update, but only the 780 has music playback. The beauty of that is when you are listening to your tunes, and the voice with the directions comes on, it momentarily silences the music, and speaks the directions, and then resumes the music again; that is sweet. What is even better is that it has the audio out jack that connects to the face mount auxiliary input jack on the front of the cars stereo so I can hear the tunes, and the directions right through the cars stereo system. With steering wheel mounted audio controls I have a lot of control with the volume, but miss the ability to skip over songs, or be able to select a playlist the way an iPod does. Nevertheless it is a great way to experience the Garmin. Both units have a built in speaker, and you can play your tunes through that on the 780 the same way, or just listen to directions on the 285WT. The problem with the 285 speaking directions at normal or mildly loud music levels with the radio on is that they are both going on at the same time. It gives you a frustrated feeling that there is too much voice traffic at once, and leaves me a little annoyed. It's like hearing 2 people talking at the same time. You can decipher both communications, but it requires more attention than you would feel comfortable with during a repeated performance. In plain words it wears on you. So the 780 eliminates that, and makes for a more enjoyable experience, since it controls the music and directions from the same source, so it has complete control. My advice is to get an 8, 16, or 32 Gig SDHC card which is the size of a postage stamp, and holds your entire MP3 collection. I also suggest that you get the SDHC that comes with the USB stick so you can easily plug that into any PC.Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card with USB 2.0 Card Reader TS8GSDHC6-S5WSo what does all of that come down to? Namely this, with the 780 you can go moving on down the highway with your tunes blaring, and never miss a turn. With the 285 you can enjoy your tunes, and do so at moderate listening levels. The 780 is a discontinued model so it is going for a bargain. It actually only sells for a fraction of its original price. I must admit the 285WT is a newer unit, according to Amazon's first sale date. The 285WT does have a clearer picture. Let's elaborate on that. Both screens are bright, and do a great job of being able to see everything, but if I had to get critical, the 285WT has whiter whites. The 780 has a manila tint to the white, and the picture is not quite as sharp. Let me emphasize not quite, because side by side you can see a very small difference, but if you saw each one of them alone, you would be hard pressed to tell the difference.Neither one of these has lane assist, and that comes in handy when you are coming over a bridge, or going through an intersection area, and want to know which lane to get in ahead of time, instead of making a last minute lane cross. It is not much of a problem most of the time.The audio is much like the video. The 285 has a slightly, and I mean slightly better sound coming out of the tiny speaker, but not enough difference to write home about.General comments: These things are not God. They are dependent on other people's maps to navigate, and that means that they are not always perfect, but I wouldn't want to live without one. The feeling of being able to hit the open road, and now you have an assistant that will take you anywhere you want to go, makes any GPS worth having. I am lousy with directions, and quite frankly don't care to become a direction expert; I have better things to daydream about when I am riding along. I always like it when the person I am riding with becomes the navigator. Now I have one that is always available and doesn't take up too much room.Couple of closing thoughts. The FM transmitter on the 780 isn't very effective. I have a rear mounted radio antennae, and I can't get the output signal to be received unless I get outside of the car, and move it within 2 feet of the antennae, so I am thankful that there is a hard wire audio output, and that I have a radio with an auxiliary input on the face. The 780 also boasts an additional hour of battery life, after all it was a unit priced in multiples of the price of the 285. They both have Bluetooth, MSN Traffic, a 4.3"" widescreen, and Garmin's features. To tell you the truth I wish it was a slam dunk, but it's not. If you don't have an aux input on your radio, and only want a GPS for a GPS then I guess the 285 is newer and a better way to go. If you want to rock out occasionally, or ride with the windows down in the summer, with an auxiliary input, the 780 is tough to beat. Hope this helps.",2,2,0.006920639,0.03489743,0.958182

"I bought the mikeless version IE2 version about 3 years ago after having wasted my time and $$ on the other off brand crap ear buds.  I travel quite a lot and wanted a a light weight in ear for shorter trips when I didn't want to take my noise cancelling over ear Comfort 2.  Of course these don't cancel the noise in a plane so you still hear the non-stop talker, the crying baby and the drone of the jet engines but the sound is loud and clear enough that you can still enjoy music or a movie.  There are a few things that I really like and ther is one big thing that I hate about these.The fit is excellent given the custom fit ""buds"" that come with the set. You get a small, medium and large set of ""buds"" so the chance of fitting your hear hole is pretty good.  They are soft and surprisingly comfortable.  Best of all they stay put even when you are active or when you happen to nod off on the plane and your head hangs like a ripe lemon.The sound is much better than anything else I have tried in an in-the-ear version.  Not up to the Bose OTE sound level but very acceptable in a lightweight, easy to carry set.  If you like heavy bass these may not be for you but if you like even sound throughout the range (high, mid and low) for music and spoken word these really excel in my opinion.  Of course everyone has their personal preference.So what's the issue?  The durability of the wire to the input jack is terrible.  I am very careful with these but noticed about a year ago that the connection at that joint was beginning to show signs of a slight tear.  Of course I don't yank the jack out when I am am through using them in my iPhone or iPad.  I did find a great suggestion online that showed how to take the spring from a ball point pen and wrap it around this joint so that it doesn't bend to far when the jack is connected.  I did that to mine and I think it saved me a few months of life in the joint.  My IE2's gave up the spirit today.  Now I am looking on AMAZON for a replacement set.  I do like these enough, for all the reasons stated, to buy a pair of the MIE2i.  But beware.  I see a lot of people with the same issue as I look at the reviews.  If I get these I am going to do the spring trick right away.  I will try to post a picture of this ""fix"" on the item page.

"I really like this unit.  It's my first and only GPS, and already it has taken away a lot of the stress of a long cross-country drive.  Its functionality is very good, and it even anticipates when you might take the wrong side when approaching a fork in the road and warns you not to, advising that you bear to the correct side.  It has very detailed, accurate information, even on small lanes inside a shopping center, which has saved me a lot of time getting oriented on an unfamiliar location.  I have not experienced any of the lockups or voice interruptions that others posting here reported.Some areas for improvement: I do not find the user interface particularly intuitive, kind of odd for a unit of this price and after years of experience designing GPS systems.  You can't operate it effectively right out of the box, but have to study the manual and experiment with the interface a lot to learn it.  And it's ridiculous for there not to be a printed manual with the product.  It also failed to warn me about a long traffic jam on one of the main roads I commute on every day (George Washington Memorial Parkway between the Capital Beltway I-495 and the bridges to Washington DC, and this could be a show-stopper -- it was one of the reasons I bought a GPS.  I'm just starting to understand that the traffic alert system is not monolithic but there are different services and sources that are hooked into different GPS products.  An executive at one of the other sources told me that his service would have caught that traffic problem while the one connected to this Magellan unit did not.  It might still be a show-stopper; if I can't get resolution on this I might exchange it for a different brand product that does get me the information I need.  It could also be that my system is not configured properly, although it does indicate that the traffic system is receiving a strong signal.In the process of setting it up and registering the product on the Magellan web site, their site was down, forcing me to register it offline with the intervention of the Magellan support staff.  I found this experience mixed.  It took several iterations to get it going.  And the product serial number stamped on the back of the unit turned out not to be in their data base and it was different from the serial number in the unit's firmware; I had to painfully retrieve that number, read it to the Magellan technical support person, and get it registered.  All of this took up a lot more time and effort than I was interested in devoting.  I still don't know if the traffic alerting function is working properly.  It should not be this challenging.I've also found that the mounting options are making it difficult to mount the unit in a way that I need, although I do not necessarily fault the product for this.  I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan, and I wear bifocals.  The windshield mount works well enough, but since the windshield of a mini-van is farther from the driver's face than in a regular car, the unit is too far from my eyes to read clearly using my bifocals, and too close to read clearly using the upper lenses in my glasses.  I found myself tilting my body forward and tilting my head up to read the thing.  Extensive searching on the Internet has not yielded a windshield suction mounted gooseneck long enough to bring the unit within range of my bifocals.  The only location that could be feasible for me is to mount it on top of the steering column, and I haven't found a mounting bracket so far that can do this, so I have to take it to the installation department at Best Buy to see if they can do it.  Even if successful, this will block my view of the speedometer.Also Amazon's handling of the delivery had a succession of severe but avoidable faults, and as a result the unit got to me almost a week after I originally put the order in with a next-day delivery, too late to get comfortable with it prior to departing on a long trip in the car.  I've bought a lot of items from Amazon and was pleased with their delivery process and its performance, but this was one of those delivery nightmares where everything went wrong for me.  Amazon was not particularly helpful in correcting their own mistakes or offering suitable compensation for my trouble and aggravation.",2,2,0.00031839003,0.0023985063,0.9972831
"If you like silicone sleeves on your Kindle, this a great choice. Many people seem to like other options for their Kindle, but as for me, I do most of my reading at home and don't want a fold over cover for my Kindle.To me, one of the advantages of a Kindle is not having to hold it like a book. I read one or no handed now and like the rubberized texture of the case which makes it prop up better, improves the button controls, and even reduces how often I accidentally touch the screen since it raises the edges around the screen just enough to assist with that.I bought a pink one and then had the opportunity to get a blue one to review a few months later. When I saw they were the same style, I was thrilled. No, this is not a case that will protect the screen while traveling about--a standard cover or a slip cover is important for traveling with a Kindle--but for most of my reading, this case is perfect. And it is once again raised enough around the screen that I can lay it face down on my nightstand and not damage or even touch the screen while preventing dust from accumulating on the screen. It doesn't add much bulk or weight but gives just a little bit of extra friction and protection to keep it from sliding out of my hands when carrying it around the house.I also used this case while battling a bad flu recently. I disinfected the case several times during my illness and recovery with Clorox wipes and such. The cover looks like new.

"The first things I noticed about this set of macro lens is that they were cheaply made. I ordered this set of diopters along with a bottom-of-the-line uncoated Hoya polarizer and got them both today from Amazon.The close-up filters grind against my lens tube and paint has already been scratched off the filters. So I would recommend a very light coating of light mineral oil before fitting the filters on your camera - e.g. valve oil for instruments would work. On the other hand, my bargain basement Hoya filter fits the lens tube like a glove - no grinding of parts during installation.Speaking of the build, the lens are metal, which exudes a certain degree of quality. They are labeled with white paint - no they aren't etched with information on magnification, and the paint is already wearing off (or was it already worn when I received it)? The paint was also smeared a little on one of filters. So quality control isn't the best, however it's no biggie. The filters are also made of glass, not plastic. I dropped one of the filters once from my chest, however it survived. I was changing the filters in a nature trail.On usage - the filters really allow you to get closer to your subjects. With the +10 diopter, your lens can be almost touching the subject and you can still lock focus and take a sharp picture. Stacking the filters only allows you to get even closer and make the subject appear even bigger in the final photo. Make sure your camera's macro mode is enabled!While I dwell on stacking the filters, there is a little bit of asymmetrical vignetting when I stack all 4 filters on my camera - the right hand corners are dark while all the other corners are just fine. Not a biggie, a little bit of cropping will have this problem easily rectified.And the filters do absorb a good amount of light so don't say you weren't warned about lower shutter speeds! Especially when stacking 4!The pouch the filters came in is a nice touch, although I could see the coarse pockets scratching the lens if the case is compressed - e.g. you put it in your pocket and sit down.As for image quality, stacking all four filters also introduces a nice bit of distortion into the image and depth of field is decreased significantly along with that little bit of vignetting covered earlier.The small depth of field that any one of the filters will give any camera makes focusing mishaps very apparent. A +10 diopter even on a compact camera with a minuscule sensor can decrease the depth of field to 1 centimeter, depending on how close your subject is! The eyes of the fly may be in focus, but the legs won't necessarily be in focus!Blue lateral CA is apparent. Looks easy enough to remove and even if you don't remove it, it's not major.Pictures using the macro filters also come out a little too soft for my taste, however that, again, is easily rectified using the Unsharp Mask in many photo editing programs. I personally use GIMP, and a little tweaking using the USM filter boosts contrast tremendously.So past the shortcomings, I am very excited to have this set of filters and look forward to acquainting myself with with them further. I do appreciate this item's ""shortcoming"" in the price department though ;).ONE MORE THING!!! You really need a good way of cleaning these lens! With these lens, every speck of dust will show up on your camera screen when composing and WILL ALSO show up in your photos!!! Mine already have a little bit of dust on them, and many of my photos are starting to look like I took them through a dirty car window!I recommend a good microfiber cloth because if you using something coarse and scratch the lens, then that scratch is going to be very prominent in every single photo. If dust specks show up, then what about a scratch!",2,2,0.11049885,0.18355621,0.70594496

"I never measured it, but I believe the receiver eye wire appears to be roughly 4-6 feet in length.  Looks like it uses a standard RCA type connector to the distribution box.  If you need a longer run, I don't know if you could simply get one of those female RCA/male RCA cables to extend.  I will update this review if I ever get a chance to try that.The ribbon cable for the flashers is a bit thin, but otherwise works well.  Going from memory, there are 5-6 flashers right on the ribbon cable and it doesn't matter which of the flashers you use to affix in front of your component's IR window.  No programming whatsoever.  Just plug in the receiver to the distribution box, pick a flasher from the ribbon cable to affix on your DVD player, Comcast Box, etc., and start using your remote control.  It automatically works; it's that easy.  The only thing I would have to say about it is that all the flashers are on one ribbon cable, so if you have components far apart, you need to split the flashers from the ribbon cable to reach your components, but the ribbon cable length seems long enough to handle reaching all your components so long as they are in the same cabinet.I put the receiver eye in eye view of my couch, just right underneath my Sony 52 inch LCD flat panel TV (I can't remember the model name, but I bought my TV from Costco at the end of 2008).

"It's a sad day when you realize your computer doesn't work and it's an even sadder day when you realize it had been boxed up for all the wrong reasons.I bought this for a 2009 MacBook Pro that had been set aside and replaced by a netbook because after two OS upgrades it just didn't want to work anymore.

I bought it anyways.After all the necessary precautions for handling sensitive electronics were taken I replaced the stock 1GB x 2 sticks and installed these 4GB x 2 sticks and reassembled the body.I knew RAM made a difference but this computer worked better than it had ever worked before. I was an affordable remedy to an expensive problem that reduced my computer to a literal paperweight. Things that had never worked at all worked better than I could have imagined, and things I thought worked fine now scream to life and the overall experience is a thousand times better.If you're looking for an affordable upgrade to your computer hardware look no further.",2,2,0.023290737,0.037508823,0.93920034
This iPod skin does what it's designed to do: protect the iPod and give the user a better skin to hold the iPod. iPod can feel slick in your hands. This skin provides a nice textured outer skin to hold it more securely. It fits well and the iPod functions nicely in it. So it does what it's advertised to do.My only gripe is there is no way that we have found to attach an armband to it. It wasn't designed or advertised for that so it's not a product fault just an observation that it could be made more usable with this feature.,2,2,0.0014607182,0.039182503,0.95935667

"Do be aware that this protector takes up an entire two-plug outlet in use but adds four outlets for additional use. The two sets of three plugins also swivel to the side so that you can put the plug close to the wall with plugins fitting into the side.  That means flat installation that will allow you to push cabinets, stands, TV's etc almost flat with the wall.  That alone is worth it but then there's the added surge protection.  It features 20db emi/rfi filtering and 2100 joules protection.  It's about two and a half times bigger than the outlet it fits into. On the back it has a three prong plugin for the top outlet and below that a plastic ground plug to fit into the bottom outlet on your wall for balance and sturdiness.  It is well made and has a little heft without too much.

"Reviewed this case as a usable option against the New Trent airbender 2.0 keyboard case.What I like:  This case is very rugged and well build.  I like using it to type, and I feel the keyboard is very comfortable to type on.  Email on the go makes the Ipad much more of a business tool and I can leave my hefty work laptop at home.  I like that it charges via micro usb, seems to last a long time, can use in portrait or landscape.What I don't like:  I feel this case is too bulky.  If I had to type emails in the rain or I worked in a coal mine, perhaps the ruggedness of this case would come in handy.  Just seems like overkill to me; I wanted the ipad for its thin size, and this case bulks it up.  I do not like the built in screen protector, as I feel it reduces some of the clarity.  Also seems a little difficult to remove the ipad from this case.Overall 4 to 4.5 out of 5.  I would recommend to others, but would probably recommend the Airbender 2.0 over this based on my preference.",2,2,0.0010808285,0.020623049,0.97829604

"I am a stickler for value and performance in products I purchase.  The Airbender keyboard clamshell case by NewTrent is excellent.  I use my iPad through out the day, including when I go to bed.  It has to perform well in daily activity as well as be comfortable to use while lying down.  Well, this case is excellent for reading iPad in bed!The case allows for 360 degree rotation of the iPad as a screen to a silky smooth bluetooth keyboard.  In addition, the iPad can be flipped over on top of the keyboard making for an iPad screen only position.  For reading in bed, I find that I can rotate the iPad to a comfortable position with both the keyboard exposed or with the iPad flipped over to conceal the keyboard.The hard plastic shell is stiff and holds the valuable iPad firmly in place, despite the gymnastics the case can provide for rotation and flipping of the iPad!  Oh, you can remove the iPad and its clamped on back protection from the case from the keyboard by simply pressing together two buttons (like a camera lens cover) on the back of the case holding the iPad.  Also, the iPad can be removed with an adjustable base unit for using the keyboard detached from the iPad.The bluetooth keyboard includes a row of iPad specific keys that speed the user along in movement around the screen as well as iPad adjustment controls.  The keyboard contains an amazing 78 keys.Charging is simple with the included cable that plugs into any available usb slot on your computer.  Connection to the iPad is done by pressing a button and then typing in a pairing code.  It then works instantly.  Once paired, it does not require repairing again.One final note.  The device uses Apple's smart cover magnets to turn off the iPad when closed.  Just be certain to have the Apple Button on the right side to position the iPad correctly to use this capability.  The case is so versatile, it can be rotated 360 degrees!I suggest a strong buy for this ClamShell Keyboard Case for iPad.",2,2,0.0006254223,0.004968046,0.9944066

"I bought a Garmin Nuvi 1450LMT for my wife for Christmas, after researching the market and trying to find a unit with the best balance of features against the price. I have two Garmin hand-held GPS receivers that I use for geocaching so I am comfortable with Garmin's GPS products, so I settled on this unit feeling confident that it would meet my wife's needs in a GPS for the car. I was right.This particular Nuvi has a large, bright display that is easily readable in direct sunlight, which was one area of concern for me. I have seen some electronic devices that are not readable in bright light such as direct sunlight and I was pleased to see that Garmin took care to ensure that the Nuvi would fare well in any lighting.When we first put the Nuvi into service we were unsure how long it would take before it would acquire satellites and be ready to navigate. Pleasantly, even before leaving the garage the Nuvi found the satellites and was ready to navigate in a short time, usually less than a minute.The Nuvi has a clear, understandable voice when she (?) speaks which is a big help. The maps are very easy to read and interpret, giving very clear indications of not just what roads to take but what lane to be in while navigating so as to be ready for turns, merges and more. It's very much like having someone give precise directions and pointing to a map right there in the car.The display shows a lot of important and useful information, including time to next event (turn, exit, etc.), speed limit, travel speed and more. One of the most important is the traffic delay indicator, something that comes in handy when trying to deal with rush hour traffic or traveling around a major interstate exchange such as the DC Capitol Beltway system. It is nice, too, that is shows the speed limit and then marks the travel speed, turning said travel speed red when it is greater than the speed limit.One of the few complaints I have about the Nuvi is that, when there is a long distance to go until the next turn or exit, the Nuvi is silent and says nothing at all until roughly one mile away from the next turn/exit. When this happens it is almost a shock to suddenly have a voice in the car. Given a choice, I personally would prefer that the Nuvi speak up every 10 minutes or so to avoid that surprise.One very weak spot I have encountered with windshield-mounted devices is the actual suction cup used. All too frequently, the cup is either very difficult to get stick on to the windshield or it does not hold well enough, letting go very unexpectedly while driving. Garmin did a very good job with their mount, making it super easy to attach to the windshield and making it adhere very well. I have never had any suction-cup-attached device attach and adhere as easily and predictably as the Nuvi.One reason I chose this specific Nuvi is for the lifetime map and traffic updates. To buy these as an after thought is very expensive though they are very important if you want the GPS receiver to remain useful.Updating the Nuvi is easy (though, understandably, it is a time-consuming process). Connecting the Nuvi to a Windows 7 64-bit laptop the OS immediately recognized the device and installed drivers. A quick visit to Garmin's website resulted in a browser plug-in being installed and shortly after that I was downloading the updates for the Nuvi. The updates are large, of course, and this is the reason the updates take a while, but the process itself is practically painless.Some reviewers complain of the Nuvi not charging and navigating at the same time. That has not been our experience. When plugged in ours has worked just fine.Our experience with the Nuvi 1450LMT has been very good and we're delighted with it. It does an excellent job with navigation, it's easy to read and understand and the map updates are the icing on the cake.",2,2,0.0029629339,0.016612828,0.9804243

"While it is obvious that these speakers cannot hang with high end speakers, they are PERFECT portable computer speakers for many reasons.  The price can seem somewhat steep considering you get speakers for the same price that include a much bigger set up, but I personally enjoy using these a lot.  They just sound great, and they look great as well, not as small as say,Bose Computer MusicMonitor -- Silver, they are much better and are not hideously overpriced like those gyp speakers are.  Here are the reasons why these speakers are great (using some of the attributes guide).Ease of Use: If you stress over wires or baffling hook-ups, these are so easy to use a young child could almost figure them out.  You don't need to hook them up to the computer aside from plugging them into the USB port.  That's all that's needed aside from some installing (software wise)!  To hook one speaker to the other, all you need to do is plug the right into the left, or vice-versa depending which side you plug in the USB.  Controls are very simple as well.  I was able to use my Macbook volume control to adjust the volume.Sound Quality: For one, the loudness of these speakers are great.  I live in a dorm, and the sound at my computer's half volume easily filled the room.  They pack a big punch for it's size, and if you aren't that big of an audiophile, then these are probably the speakers you are looking for.  They do lack in bass, but for those who sometimes find bass distracting in things that don't require it, the minimal bass will work to a tee.  Most of all though, they have the power needed to be useful, and quite frankly, that's what gives these speakers such a forceful impact.  They pack a full bodied sound needed with a good set of speakers to handle many situations, and that's one thing they do extremely well.Features: Of course many speakers aren't going to be featured loaded, but besides ease of use, they have some interesting features.  The left speaker let's you adjust the volume level or mute it.  It also let's you skip through songs, and it also let's you pause the music, as well as stopping the music.  I used it on iTunes and it worked like a charm.  While not a feature of the speaker itself, the sturdy travel case works as both protecting the speakers and making the speakers easy to carry with little hassle with a little space.Design: Another big selling point is the design, which is excellent.  Aside from having some convenient features and being EXTREMELY easy to set up, they are constructed ruggedly, and they look great, as well as being designed with dimensions in mind.  They are durable and are not made of plastic, and the front is covered by strong and hard mesh.  There is a total of two wires to the whole thing, which makes the design very simple.  It does not need batteries, and it does not drain them very much.  I personally find them aesthetically pleasing, and very convenient.  They are not very wide, they are moderately tall, they look nice, etc. I think it just takes some handling of them and you will be very much convinced.When it comes to quick convenient speakers that don't requite power and are extremely portable, and if you are looking for big sound in a small package and want sound that packs a punch, then consider purchasing these, and you won't regret it.  If you are looking for great powerful speakers in such a small package to replace the speakers in your laptop (which are almost always awful, but you know that already), then consider purchasing these speakers.  The list price is a bit high, but at this price I think it's even better.",2,2,0.00084989605,0.0048985956,0.9942515

"Okay, I didn't buy it on Amazon, but I paid exactly the same price. The price is pretty consistent no matter where you look, except maybe at Dell where everything seems to cost more. This is a portrait lens. On my camera, although it appears to be a longer lens -- 136 on my Canon T3 which has the 1.6 optical factor due to the smaller sensor. However, the optical qualities are the same regardless of the field of view you get and these optical qualities are FANtastic.Does everyone look better shot with this lens? Maybe. The portraits I've taken with it are delicious. Color is beautiful and the bokeh? Wow. For flowers and other close up nature pictures, it may produce the most artistic images for the least amount of effort of any lens I have ever used on any camera and THAT is saying a lot because I've been taking pictures as a serious amateur and occasionally professional level for more than 40 years.It has a VERY strong focusing preference for sharp foreground with blurred backgrounds. If you try to convince it to work the other way (soft foreground, sharp subject back) it tends to argue with you and you have to either switch to manual focus (the simpler choice) or keep playing around with the autofocus until it finally takes the hint, after which you get a great picture.It is also surprisingly good for landscapes if you use higher apertures -- f8 and up. Sharp. Gorgeous texture. Great color. Since I'm fond of shooting from dark into light (e.g., in the woods on a dark path in deep shade out to a brightly lit lake using trees as silhouettes to frame the shot) and for this purpose, it works superbly and focuses without complaint. It helps to use center weighted or spot metering, or at least that's what works best for me.The lens is moderately heavy, especially for a prime, but not overwhelming. I have bad wrists and have no trouble using it. I haven't used it on a tripod yet. I haven't needed one because the lens is fast and with the IS working, remarkably forgiving.I was feeling guilty about spending the money, but I'm SO happy with the lens, I have forgiven myself. As really great lenses go, the price tag is pretty modest. It may be about as good a value for performance as you are ever going to get.Use it for things it is good at and you will be thrilled with the results. Use it on higher apertures for some remarkable landscapes. No broad vistas, obviously, but still some pretty cool stuff you can do with it.All in all, I am delighted with this lens. If you shoot a lot of people, it may be the best lens available regardless of price. If there is a better lens for portraits, I haven't heard about it.I should emphasize that taking shots of flowers twined with fences and other close focus nature pictures where a great bokeh can be the make/break for the picture, well ... I've taken pictures on the fly that I barely bothered to look at before snapping and they came out looking like art. Gorgeous.I can't find anything wrong with it ... assuming you have a grip on what it can do and what are its inherent strong suits.",2,2,0.002941985,0.010998339,0.98605967
"The Amazon Kindle 2 Silicone Skin Case Gel Cover in Clear is a very protective item for my Kindle.  I have a case to keep my Kindle in, but there is always the chance of dropping it by accident or bumping the corners.  Happily, my Kindle is multi-layered now.  Under the Silicone Case Gel Cover is one of the beautiful skins, and the clear cover allows that to show through on the back and the sides where it covers it.  The gel cover is very hardy and I feel that if I did drop my Kindle, it wouldn't suffer more than a bounce because the gel cover is thicker at the corners and has two strips down the back that are thicker, also.  I've had so many people ask me, ""Is that a Kindle?"" and then say, ""That's beautiful!"" because of the skin, so I'm happy that I purchased the clear cover so that the prettiness still shows.  I'm very happy with this!",2,2,0.00062959053,0.00219447,0.99717593

"What a great idea.  Before going on vacation, we set it up for a few nights to see how it worked and where the best location in the room would be.  My nephew and his girlfriend stopped by and asked who was watching TV upstairs.  That sold it for us. Make sure you go outside and check to insure that you can't see it.  We had to lower it in the upstairs bedroom instead of just sitting it on the actual TV.  In the living room, I discovered if I reversed the blinds when they're closed so someone coming up to the door would only be able to look up and can't look down through the blinds, I was able to put the Fake TV fairly close to the window. One important thing, test it first to get the best location for your house.  Also, if you have it set to dusk for four or seven hours, you can't turn a light on in that room or it will think dusk happened later than it really did.  For example, if you turn a light on at midnight, when you turn the light off, it will start again and be on for four or seven hours depending on your setting.

"I am quite pleased with these little 'phones.  I was given an iPod and since the included buds were just abysmal and since I travel a lot....well, it was a prudent purchase :-)I have three sets of Noise Cancelling headphones (the others are sennheiser and panasonic) and these little MDRNC11's have a very similar ability to dim ambient noise in a MUCH smaller package - perfect for my dawn and midnight runs and they are great on the airplane, the bus and the office.After a great deal of futzing with the included (and VERY comfortable) silicone ear moulds the sound is now fantastic on my iPod.  I am still listenint to MP3's (or MP4's) so the sound is not audiophile quality but I am quite happy with what I hear.In other reviews some of the folks has mentioned the bass-heavy nature of these drivers - yes, they are a tad bass heavy, but on the iPod the ""acoustic"" setting rounds them out very well.The vast majoriety of music I listen to is classical and jazz.  The opening track of ""Jazz at the Pawnshop"" is littered with lovely ambient noises that come through very well.  As this is a pretty standard track for demoing audiophile sound systems, I would say that for $100 I got a heck of a bang for my buck :-)Again, MP3's (even the ones from apple.com) still sound like MP3's, but these little buds reproduce the music with elan.

This is great for quick scrolling of the internet, but I do not recommend it as a Counter Strike tactic)The Bad:-The right and left click are loud in a low noise environment. (read: Class) This is due to the great tactile response that was remarked on earlier, like any good mouse should have, but it is the only thing that keeps me from using this mouse during my every waking moment. The clicks are not loud enough to draw the attention of a teacher in lecture, but if I end up in a tense situation in Fallout, clicking frantically in the middle of class, students around me notice.

"First, I do not recommend that you load your bag as heavily as I do. I tend to add items weighing in around 60-65 pounds when all is said an done. This is the reason I purchased this bag.The bag itself has a heavy leather outer shell, poly-acrylic-foam internals, great construction, heavy stitching, and a telescopic handle for what appears to be an ABEC bearing based wheel assembly (smooth roll).You can fit the kitchen sink into the pockets; of which it has many that are large enough to hold nearly any item you would typically load into a computer bag.I have been abusing this bag for over 2 years, and finally, the metal connectors on the strap broke due to the weight. (Note: because of heavy usage, I've gone through a strap every 6 months or so on other bags).Because I like the bag, and wanted a matching strap,I called SOLO directly, pressed 1, for customer service, and recieved a service agent who took my number and address down and is shipping a new strap, free of charge. I was advised that the strap might not 'match' due to dyes' etc. But that the base color/target color (tan) is what would be sent as the replacement. Typically, this transaction would cost you 15-20 dollars from a 3rd party, adding 5 to 15 dollars shipping costs.Excellent value, The bag's typical cost is competitive or better than comparable quality computer bags with rollers.

"I received this camera in 2005 when I graduated from college. I mainly used it as a point and shoot camera, since I'm not familiar with the multiple settings that it has on it. It was my first digital camera, and I was just thrilled I could use it to check the quality of my pics on the spot (the previous year I had gone to Europe, and a great deal of my 35mm shots were junk and I didn't know it until I returned).This camera, as of this writing, is probably considered 'old'. It's only 5mp, and the back LCD screen is smallish compared to what is out there today. It is slightly bulky, but I've come to appreciate that; the new point-and-shoots are quite slim, but this Kodak affords your hands some purchase. The battery lasts a good long while, and it comes with a wall adapter that you use to charge it with. I believe you can buy a dock for the entire camera as well to load to your computer directly, but I have just been using an SD card to transfer photos.Another nice feature that I haven't seen much of recently is the old-style viewfinder in addition to the screen. This is nice when outdoors and the sun is washing out the screen to the point of it being virtually unusable.What I really like about this camera is the lens. It is a Schneider-Kreuznach lens, which apparently has made a tremendous difference with the quality of the pictures I've been taking. Let me explain:Last year I was to go on a trip, and I thought a newer point and shoot camera might be easier to travel with. I bought a Samsung SL605 on clearance without checking specs or reviews (dumb, I know). The trip was cancelled, but upon messing with the camera, many pics came out blurry or grainy, especially at a higher ISO (when I would mess with the settings). The low light images were poor with little definition and a lot of 'noise'.Now, that may have just been that camera. And it also might have had to do with some internal limitations on its part. But the Samsung lens was simply labeled 'Samsung lens'. I am assuming (perhaps erroneously) that it is of a poorer quality than the Kodak. Many of the same pics repeated with the Kodak yielded much better results.In all, it is an older camera, and some features aren't as good as they could be (the macro setting has never been very good for up-close pics, for example). But I still love it. It takes great pics, especially when I sell items on eBay, and I hope it keeps ticking!",2,2,0.004200652,0.019492779,0.9763065

"I had a Samsung LCD that was about 2 years old and wanted to upgrade to a LED type LCD. I did some research and was leaning towards another Samsung but then Sears put this Sony on Sale and that changed my mind. I didn't think I could afford this type of TV before the sale price. I went ahead and purchased the Sony. ( I almost switched to the Samsung when I went to pick it up) Once I got the TV hooked up and seen the picture quality, I thought I made a big mistake. I started playing with the picture adjustments (there are a bunch by the way) and could not get the picture anywhere close to the quality of my old Samsung. I was getting ready to box it up and take it back when I decided to look up some recommended picture settings online. I found lots of different opinions on what others did to help the picture quality but they didn't work for me. I then remembered reading previously online about a problem someone was having with there new TV and they ended up turning off the light sensor that adjusts the picture darkness to the room lighting. I went ahead and turned off the light sensor and WOW, what a difference. The picture now had the ""POP"" that I was looking for. I like a brighter picture and even in a brightly lit room, the sensor kept the screen too dark. Now if I watch this Sony for a while and then go look at my Samsung (Hooked up in mancave), there is no comparison. The Sony wins hands down. I have looked at a few short 3D clips that are available online and they are not bad. I have not messed with any of those settings yet but I am sure I will.Pros: Gorilla glass, bright clear picture, does a good job with reflections, quality of buildCons: Picture degrades very slightly when viewed from an angle, I have to go through the wireless set up again if I don't use it for a while(switching to cable), stand is not sturdy (has a spring in it that allows the TV to wobble easily if touched)",2,2,0.047986638,0.05036868,0.90164465

"The price on this item compared to others I looked at is outstanding and it's better quality than I would have expected.  I got it Prime for less than $70.  Seems like that fluctuates.I used it to mount my 53 pound Panasonic 55"" LE54.Nicely made and not flimsy in any way. A newer TV should not need the plastic spacers.  The plastic spacers are plastic to avoid damaging the back of the TV, and are plenty substantial if needed, which in most cases will not be.I am not deducting stars for the sub-par manual. Beyond typos, there are inadequate warnings, such as ""Don't use the supplied anchors in drywall!"", for the less mechanically inclined.  The pictures are too small and could have been drawn with better clarity.  It looks like the website is weak on support also.Make sure to use the 4 washer plates on the vertical brackets on the back of the TV, and the washers on the bolts for the mounting plate. If using in a cement wall, make sure you know what diameter drill to use or the anchors may fail.  For drywall, make sure to pick up 2 studs, and use no larger than a 3/16""-1/4"" bit. Lubricating the lag bolts will make it easier to tighten them and might make it less likely to over-tighten them..I removed the articulating arms when I mounted the wall plate.  It made it way easier than trying to hold the entire assembly up and getting the bracket level. I did not even need to adjust level after the TV was mounted.  The only caveat is is that reinstalling the arm assembly it a bit tricky.  You have to get the flanged bushings, washers, and bolts reinstalled, which takes some coordination. Also, there is not diagram for how they all are assembled so I present the following:there are two flanged bushings which go through the holes in the wall bracket from the outside of the holes.  The flange of the bushing going into the top hole is on top of the bracket, the flange on the bottom goes in from the bottom.  You will have to install the bottom one after the top is started. The washer fits over the small end of the flanged bushing on the inboard side of the bracket. The hole in the arm fits over the small end of the flanged bushing which takes a little coordination, especially on the bottom bushing. An extra hand would be helpful, but not absolutely necessary.  Just start the bolt through the top bushing and fiddle with the bottom bushing and washer until the bushing engages the hole in the arm.  Tricky but doable, and is much easier than trying to level 25+ pounds of metal. You only re-assemble one arm at a time (obviously) into the wall plate, and the other side will be easier since you do not have to hold the whole thing up when reassembling.  If you are not good with your hands, don't try this.  Just get ""Tiny"" to hold the up whole mess when mounting to the wall as the manual suggests.I thought I would need help lifting the TV onto the wall mount, but I left the stand on the whole time which I was using on a cabinet.  I only had to lift the TV about 8"" straight up to engage the two horizontal arms. I pulled the arms out until the hooks were almost aligned with the horizontal arms. Don't try this if you cannot easily lift and balance the TV.  Don't flex the panel either.  I had a little trouble with the locks which were wedged in front of the horizontal bars after hooking the TV to the mount.  Just loosen the bottom nut and screw until you can move the lock plate sideways and up underneath the curve of the horizontal bar.  After I was locked, I removed the stand.I highly recommend this mount and would buy another if I have to install another large (say >37"") TV. This mount weighs 30 pounds. I would choose a lighter duty mount for a smaller TV.  This thing is rated at 165# which I think includes the TV plus the mount itself.  Plenty for 100# or so total.EDIT: I ADDED A SKETCH OF WHAT THE WALL BRACKET, BOLT, BUSHINGS, WASHERS, AND LOCK NUT SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

"Bought two of these to protect Samsung tablets that were to be given as gifts to 5 year old boys.  My boys are not out and out careless with their belongings, but they are unavoidably 5 years old, and as such they are rather hard on just about everything.  The cases have happily dealt with several drops and many hours of poking, pulling, use as makeshift race cars, and everything else that a 5 year old will subject pretty much every item to.  They provide a decent amount of impact protection, yet they are not overly thick or bulky.  The magnetized clasp on the screen cover is very useful as it forcefully grabs the cover when little fingers are not so careful.

"My wife & I use this in our new place with her computer that I bought her. It's got an HDMI out. We do have a smart TV but I fiddled with that feature when we first got our TV & it's a dumb feature. Coneecting the HDMI to her computer takes literally 5 seconds. My smart TV function takes 10 to 15 seconds to launch, then you gotta go through some menus... whatever. I don't have the time or patience to deal with that everytime we wanna hook up her computer to the tv.When connected to her computer, the tv fires up the super crisp image immediately. We've used the cord to watch movies, wedding & honeymoon videos & pictures, etc. We needed a 15' one so that we can comfortably sit on the couch & use the laptop with the long HDMI cord plugged into the computer & TV. The setup works VERY well.Picture quality is awesome with this thing, audio is very good too. My home theater receiver is from 2000, it does not have HDMI capability, Only optical inputs. I have an optical out from the TV running to the receiver. I've tested the audio from a souce that ran 5.1 Digital Digital output to the receiver then compared to the audio the receiver put out after receiving the non 5.1 signal from the TV. It was VERY similar. It was not as good, I'm sure, as if I had an HDMI receiver that would be able to use an HDMI out from my TV, but I'm not too worried about getting 100% 5.1 audio from watching a quick video on the TV off the computer. The rear surround speakers still put out audio, it's just not as defined as it would've been had I had an HDMI receiver. I thing when there's an optical link somewhere in the HDMI connection, it prevents 5.1 & downgrades it possibly as part of that DHCP business.All in all, super nice cord, high quality connector ends. The cord itself is nice & fat, a good sign. Lots of shielding, I'm sure. To use & put away, our cord has contoured to a certain pattern of how I winded the cable when not in use. It's pretty easy to get it to go back to the coiled pattern after we're done using it each time. We then just tuck the coil under the left corner of the TV in the TV slot of our big bookshelf style entertainment center. I really like this cable & would very much recommend it if it's something that your particular setup is calling for.***EDIT - 2/02/14 - I was still curious & not definitive/ entirely convinced about the HDMI in (to the tv, source is the Comcast X1 cable box), optical out (running via an optical cable from my relatively newer 60"" Sharp Aquos to my old-school, circa 2000 Pioneer 500w home theater 5.1 Dolby Digital receiver). The 1st article I came across after Googling this issue instructed to see if the tv has an option in the set-up menu to change the audio out from PCM to Dolby Digital or raw. There, indeed, was an option to toggle it & it actually worked on my set-up :D The option, though, was not in audio settings on my tv menus, as one would think... It was under the ""system options"" menu then under ""terminal settings."" Then there's an ""audio setup."" It was on PCM, I switched it to Bitsream. 5.1 Baby!!! I'm pretty fortunate to have caught this now & not much later down the road. I've had the tv for about 4 months... Better late than never I guess.***EDIT #2 - From time to time I'll listen to channel 703 on my Comcast box. It's the EDM (Electronic Dance Music) channel in the block of music channels. Actually, the audio sounded like s*** when ouput in 5.1 Dolby Digital. It was severely lacking lacking subwoofer bass. So I switched the signal back to PCM just for this application. The bass was back & it sounded a lot better. The Bitstream setting works better for movies & shows that output 5.1 Dolby Digital. For music channels, the PCM output is better. Think about it, most music is simply in stereo with some bass. So it makes sense that the PCM output would be MUCH better for music.",2,2,0.00469517,0.008858837,0.986446

I owned the blue pair before and I really like the black ones.-Very comfortable...unlike earbuds, these don't feel like your ear is getting probed.Cons:-Definitely could not use it for running! These are the kind of headphones I would wear while lounging in a chair or doing something not too active. Maybe my ears are too small, but these don't feel as secure on my ear as I originally expected. In that sense, I like by Philips earbuds which I use to go running.Really for 10 dollars, you are getting a pretty solid deal. Like I mentioned, you get good sound and quality. Fitting is an issue that depends on your ears ;-).",2,2,0.039571665,0.17997332,0.78045505
"I've got a GoPro 3 Silver which, at 720p, takes about 2 hours of video before the batteries die.

"I did months of research before choosing the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. I shoot a lot of architecture and nature, but I'm not ready for a DSLR, so I went for a super zoom. This one keeps focus all the way out.The IA mode is great for most situations, but I can't wait to work with the dozens of other settings. One intriguing feature is the ability to shoot in RAW format. As I understand it, I can shoot in RAW, manipulate the picture in the accompanying software, and then save it in .jpg. I'm going to experiment with that!The camera is extremely light. It's easy to sling it over my shoulder as I walk. It doesn't feel plastic and cheap, like some have said. It's ready to shoot mere seconds after I turn it on, and the auto focus and hand-steadying features make it easy to use when I come across a great shot.In short, I love this camera so far.

"I wanted to test-drive this keyboard not because I have an iMac but because I wanted a smaller keyboard attached to my laptop's docking station. The iHome is, indeed, smaller but I'm afraid I am going to revert back to my old, much larger, much trusted and also much better suited to heavy typing traditional keyboard.The main feature or advantage this keyboard offers is its providing a full keyboard, keypad included, on a small size. Anyone used to chiclet-style keyboards may find this to be a great one. I am able to type pretty fast on it but I will always prefer 'sculpted' keys that travel a little more than the iHome's and make less noise when you hit them. The keyboard's other feature is its 2 USB ports. Given that you use one USB port to connect your keyboard to... in my case the monitor, there is a net game of one USB port when using the iHome. Finally, it comes with Volume Up and Volume Down keys that worked well with my non-Mac computer.The small form factor make the iHome a good pick if you don't type a lot. I will not subtract stars because the iHome doesn't meet my personal preferences but I will subtract one because the keyboard, while probably well built, looks feels a little cheap.",2,1,0.024117777,0.5654856,0.41039667

"I consider myself a technology enthusiast who has replaced multiple hard drives in multiple notebooks and desktops over the years. I usually just install a clean copy of Windows whenever I install a new hard drive, but I've also used various types of software to clone hard drives so that I don't have to re-install Windows.I can honestly say that this is the easiest upgrade kit and easiest cloning software I've ever used. Just remove your old hard drive from your notebook, install the new SSD, install the old hard drive into the provided external enclosure and connect it to a USB port on your notebook, then insert the install CD into the drive and follow the on-screen instructions.Best of all, the solid state drive (SSD) provides trouble-free shock protection for all your data (no more crashing hard drives) and it will make your laptop feel faster as well. Just be sure that you're using this kit with a laptop/notebook that has a SATA hard drive and not an older IDE hard drive interface.Pros:-- Includes an external USB enclosure so you can use your old hard drive after you've replaced it with an SSD.-- Includes the easiest cloning software I've ever seen.-- Provides a nice boost to laptop performance at a fair price.Cons:-- No printed copy on the installation instructions. You have to print out the instructions from the PDF document included on the CD.-- If you have a larger hard drive you need to delete files off your old drive so that it takes up enough room to fit on the smaller SSD before you can clone the drive.-- Since this is a budget-priced SSD it is faster than a traditional hard disk drive but isn't as fast as some of the more expensive SSDs offered by Kingston and other companies.",2,2,0.0010313576,0.0024033377,0.9965654

"I bought this camera about 4 months ago, and the camera itself is not bad, even without taking cost into consideration.  It isn't the best quality image, but when I go back and look at the video I recorded, I can read the text on signs, moving license plates, whatever happens to be in the frame.  It has a noticeable fish-eye distortion.  If you like the wider angle that provides, that's great.  If not, you might not like it.  The camera has a switch to select between HD and FHD (720p vs 1080p) and I personally like the 720p better because it records more frames per second, which provides a somewhat better picture.  I noticed that when recording at 1080p sometimes the image seemed jumpy or wobbly.  If good quality at 1080p is a must, I would recommend you look for something else.My biggest complaint is that the battery has very poor life at low temps, which is a bit of a shame for an action camera.  I initially bought it intending to record winter sports, so I have to keep it somewhere warm and be selective about when I record.  Well below 0F, don't expect it to last more than a few minutes.  In above freezing temps, it will record for hours on a charge.I've never owned a camera from a premium brand, so I can't really compare to that.  I don't feel the need to find out, unless I can find confirmation that a more expensive camera will work for a significant amount of time at temps much below freezing.",2,1,0.067796946,0.83917147,0.09303163

"I have been using the Plantronics 906 since I got then in June 2010. While they are still going strong I ran across these and decided to upgrade. I use them for weight lifting several times a week for a few hours at a time. I was a bit worried that these would not stay in place while moving around but I can not shake them loose. Putting than on you can feel them grip your ear but the remain comfortable. I them can shake my head with all my might and they stay put.As far as sound they are a very noticeable upgrade. When the music started I could not believe how clear and loud they were. I thought my 906s were good but these blow them away. They are also very isolating. They are much like wearing earplugs and keep out the gym noise and terrible gym music very well.I really liked how easy they were to start using. When you turn them on for the first time they pair with your device and your ready to go. The cord is also a good length and the buttons are a good size making them easy to negotiate.UPDATE:I got these in Aug, its now Dec.I still love them. They have been performing well and have really made an improvement in the gym. The only thing I can say bad is the battery just makes it for me. I'm a total gym rat and can have some long workouts. They have never run dead but I have completed workouts with them announcing they are low on power. For most people this will probably not be an issue but I do wish they last a bit longer.

After about 1000 shots trying different mode I'm about to give up on this bad boy. I'm about to head back to Best Buy and return this one and hold on to my S95. Just couple hours before the store open, I decided to give this bad boy the last chance. I loaded the photos of the s95 and the s100 in my computer and compared them on my  Eizo ColorEdge CG243W 24.1"" Widescreen LCD Display. And boys I was just in shock.

Talking about near SLR quality  very close to my 50D with 15-85mm IS) awesome dynamic range wow wow !!! the s95 photos are beautiful but no comparison to the s100.

"I have owned my Nikon 8700 for almost two years and have taken over 7000 photos.  It is a very good serious amateur's camera and might make a reasonable back-up for a professional phtotographer. The 8 megapixel resolution is enough for moderately sized prints, up to about 11 x 14, assuming no cropping.The zoom lens is reasonably fast and quite convenient.  Autofocus is normally pretty good, but as one approaches close-up shots with long focal length and moderate or low light, it fails quite regularly.  One can see it 'hunt' right through the perfect focus and choose something not even close.  Otherwise, the optics seem pretty good.  The viewfinder is bright, but it is really small. It will indicate whether the subject is in the frame, but it will give only a hint of what the final result will look like.  This puts it at a great disadvantage to real ""through the lens"" slr's.It will produce very sharp images under moderately favorable conditions.  There is  only a little barrel distortion and vignetting at short focal lengths, and virtually no chromatic aberration. The jpeg compression, comes in three flavors: basic, normal, and fine.  Basic is alright for small snapshot photos and shots of very smooth things, but it produces a lot of jpeg artifacts when trees are cast against the sky or other places where irregular edges contrast with the background. Fine mode has very little of this problem.  In-camera sharpening works reasonably well, though even the lowest level will produce banding artifacts in high contrast areas. These will typically be visible only during image editing, though.Color reproduction is generally quite good, but dark and midtone colors between blue and red - especially those between magenta and red - will often appear to be qualitatively very different in the photo from what they do to the eye.  It is something that can be repaired in Photoshop, but anyone without a really solid image-editing program will be tempted to throw the camera against the wall.  In other words - if you want this camera, you need to have an image editing program that allows adjustment of curves, and adjustment of hue and saturation for the six primary and secondary colors. My cheap Fujifilm 2800 is much more faithful with these reds.With eight different modes of operation including landscape, flowers, indoor portrait, fireworks, and panorama, the electronics offer a good variety of modes.  I use floral and landscape all the time, and they work quite well.  Floral mode offers five zones that you can use for focus and exposure metering, making this a really handy mode for all kinds of close work.Other modes are not quite as good.  I tried nightime landscape last night.  It was a full moon  - one of those 'bright as day' nights.  But the shutter did not stay open long enough to register any sort of an image, except for a ghostly dark gray image of some pure  white surfaces. Similarly, the flash manages to make everything look ugly.  This may not be a quality unique to this flash, but I would never use the flash except for cases of slight fill when the subject was 6-10 feet away. In its defense, there is a hot shoe and if I were not in the habit of using natural light for everything, I should have mastered this art by now.Most of the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  There is a bank of controls that naturally falls beneath the left hand when one is steadying the camera.  These include the jpeg adjustment, self timer, and the flash mode selector.  I have ruined many dozens of shots by accidently pressing one of these.  Almost every photo-shoot in moderate or low light finds me waiting for the self-timer. And I went a whole shoot doing ""basic"" mode when I intended ""fine.""The body is solid and it is mechanically quite sound. It fits the hands quite comfortably. Fit and finish are very soli.  After two years of moderate use, the camera seems none the worse for the wear. Even the decals are in mint condition  I have two batteries and a charger, and find that this is just barely enough. I also bought a 1 gigapixel card and would not reecommend anything less.I have owned three film SLR's and I could never recommend trading to this camera from a film SLR.  I have scanned a number of slides and am sure that this  camera produces an image, that is is better than one from a 35mm, but one quickly misses the control one is used to shooting manually with an SLR.  I bought this camera at the same time as a Pentax 6x7 medium format camera, and I find myself using this for almost everything because it is so much more convenient and portable.  And only in the case of images that would be over 20 inches on a side is the advantage of high resolution one that makes the Pentax a better choice.  For those serious about fine art landscapes and other photos with much detail, medium format film will still beat this camera or, probably any digital camera for detail.  But for less than poster-sized pictures under normal shooting conditions, it is hard to beat this camera.",2,1,0.19734167,0.70765877,0.094999604

"I'm traveling in Greece right now as I type this, having brought only the Zi8 to document the feta-feasting, Mythos-swilling, and bazouki-blaring experience.  Usually on scenic excursions like this I'll bring a little Sony CyberShot camera (old 3-megapixel model) and a JVC digital video camera that plays mini digital cassettes.  Being a bit more restricted for space and weight (thanks Ryanair!) I decided to see if my fairly new Kodak Zi8 could fill the bill for both.  It will take 5 megapix digital photos, and videos in the following modes: WVGA, 720p, 720p/60 fps, and even 1080p (full Hi-Def)And the results?Well, as long as lighting is good, this thing performs fairly well.  Plenty of sunshine here, so that's not usually a problem...at least during the day.  Want to take some evening pix?  That's a problem.  Not having a flash, the Zi8 uses only available light, and does so poorly.  Worse, the low-light pictures look really grainy, like it's a frozen still from a video feed.  In full light, pix are fairly clear, but the color isn't very vibrant, and neither the color nor the clarity seems as good as my old Sony CyberShot.Video performs ably, and the quality of the 1080p hooked up to our HD television is pretty dang impressive.  BUT, most folks aren't working in HD format for home movies, and even if you have the software and equipment to edit and work with it, many friends and families (mine anyway) don't have the hardware to watch and enjoy it, so I find myself mostly recording in normal WVGA mode.  Lastly, if you're a PC person, the video format (QuickTime favored ""*.mov"") isn't well-liked by some of my video-editing software, and I have to convert it before I can import it into my editor.Final thoughts:I bought this for about $160, and it's now down to $115 (new model must be coming out).  My other equipment, though performing better, takes up more space and in today-bucks would run about $300-400 to buy.  SO, if you want easy performance with a small foot print on space requirements for a fairly low price, this is pretty awesome.  I'm a little pickier about the quality, and like to edit my own video quite a bit, so it's a little less awesome for me.  Still, all in all, an easy 4-star rating.Oh yeah... a forgotten negative:  though there is a zoom, there isn't a focus feature on the camera other than a switch.  One setting is for ""infinity distance"" and the other setting is for ""about 15 centimeters"" distance (paraphrasing what the instruction book says).  The problem is NEITHER setting works for something about 2 feet away.  I've taken several photos at about the 2-3 foot range, and they're blurry using either focus setting.  I guess I could move back to about 6-8 feet and then zoom in to make it LOOK like I'm only two to three feet away, but that's kind of stupid.  SOOOOOOO...as long as things are well-lit, and further away than 4 or 5 feet, the Zi8 works great.  I just finished editing some footage of Greece in Sony Vegas, and I was really impressed by how it came out.  Granted it was a pain in the butt converting all the *.mov files before I could import them, but that's just one of the negatives weighing against the size and convenience...hence that 4-star rating.",2,2,0.005967334,0.010420965,0.98361164

And that's where the simiaRitzy to everyother camera on the market ends!  It has burst mode ten shot full soliton pictures at o.1 seconds between frames so you can dissect a timed event like a race ending into ten super high resolution images. This was not possible before this. This is ten times faster and way more resolution that HDTV cameras costing thousands.Sticking with the lens it goes from macro , close without do galt, actual,optical lens to 1/2 inch that is not available in the old dslr with the most expensive macro lens they were limited to 2 cm , about and inch the spec say 1 cm about 1/2 an inch inside the flower with  the most pixels in the raw picture!  OK so,regular lens design for six to,theity feet , limited by the flash at thirty mostly and the ratio has to do,with the minute details of a lens. , now you can optical zoom out to a 22 from standard 150 lens , and that is a zoom that is better than most handheld sighting scopes binoculars and mid end telescopes! Now if you keep selecting past optical zoom it seem less ly switches and display in huge LCD display or pure purist through the eye piece the optical,fifty and it multiplies up to,20 or 22 depending on which model, that's  1000:1 telescope ce to 1/2 macro same Carl Zoe's, best optics for over 125 years, the hard part of lens is making them cover this large of a field of view and the colors don't focus at the same point due to minute change in wave length from red to blue, that what makes a great lens it's call chromatic distortion whe looking at specs , there is nothing at all like this.Let talk,about other interesting mode, beside the ten frame burst, this camera take full HDTV and stereo with Dolby encoding! This is found in 10 K and up commercial HDTV video cameras. Now here's an amazing feature while your shooting a movie, you can decide that a picture would be great but you want to keep,taking video just push button and in between frames of video,a full resolution , higher than HDTV , 1080 p, is taken. No,camera does that Sony patented many od these features so you won't get this inany other.More feature for group,picture,or facial portraits it has smile and blink detection built in to autofocus it ha facial,recognition and it take two pictures back to back and wil,take another whe inside and it likes that smile better than the first two. It like having a director. Human inside they body... Now you can turn off full auto go to,part auto, and play with say depth of field,by controlling exposure by one stop one and ahF stop to two stops. For photographers  and the rest it changes the way the background looks compared to the main focal,point. It also can add or lower ..blur which if done right adds a speedy look instead of freezing the person. Most photog swill,shoot auto, and a few with different exposures. For you folks that like to take pictures of meteor showers it will hold the exposure as long as four seconds, and as short as less than 1/1289 of a second. Truely an amazing rangeNow let's talk about lighting this used to be the hardstart of film photography and was a serious limit with early video planes, then CCDs cameras, this is state of the art CMOS meaning each pixel is addressed individually instead of reading ou a row or column , you can imagine that there is some distortion if you take a row of say 100 K pixel , across each other, this is called line leakage, you won't see this spec,or,effect since this Sony uses there r ex or ,patented CMOS sensor. So,what's it mean to users. I took a picture at sunset , from a pon 1/4 mile away of my house with a little zoom to fill frame no light , too far anyway, and the picture looks just like taken at high noon, next picture I zoomed all the way in and focused by hand, I shoot guns so I,can hold my breath and shoot, anyway the sit and house number takes up about two by two,feet at almost full,zoom but not  all,they way just to fill the frame I can read. The sign clearly and the house number. Binocular could not resolve this delatil,at that distance. So it ake picture with very little,light and it processes it to be color corrected that the white sign and black letter against reddish town brick are absolutely spot onNow there are features to take a regular picture and add effects that you used to use a program,like,adobe or many other to do,these fun effects, Apia, cartoon, and others I,have to learna about I,think,this camera is a unit you can grow into,and learn over a few months of shooting a few days ata time, the see results, add  and read a few new features and then see what those do, until you maste all,the effects,There more, the bundle allows for more memory extra memory high end battery spare battery and three differnt charger, read the specs but this is great, it all,comes Ina right sized camera bag not to big not too,small but requires packaging  . Once you register you get SONYS pm photo manger, some packages come witha basic photo re touching program , these mostly do,the same if your serious and want to phony photos  photoshop,is the tool, bit a good,photoshop,operator,take many hours to be average, and a year to be magazine ready. But the camera picture are good enough right out,of the hdmi for typical userOk killer app it takes 3 d photos and video using Sony active 3 d probably everybody's active 3 d , the specs have the standard. That s just amazing .The manual is good and Sony has a downloadable book 100 pages to go into camera and photography details!  They help,you be better with all camera but show you typical phot tools and how to activate on this a era.Ergonomic, the button are I the right place, there is built in hel incase you,need a memory jog, there are so,any extra you need to grow I to this it's the last camera you will need for... At least decade it will,take that long for,the other today this , by then Sony will revolutionize the camera again.I love this camera, everybody Iknow more camera and tech savy love this camera and they can pick it up,and shoot,and play withhotot,since the controls,are the same as Sony, cannon, Panasonic Lu,infix as some of these companies have been combined and ergonomic whe right stay for decades. This is a point and shoot , a videographers dream and a telescope,with amazing focal plane  you can see inside a airplane window above you 5000 feet,a mile easy.

"For the money, a great set of earbuds. Nice selection of cushions to get just the right fit. I didn't notice them transferring a lot of sound through brushing against the wiring, nor did the wiring seem extremely thin or hard/inflexible. The sound was nice, but I have no experience with the ""earbud"" style of headphones, so I can't compare them to other brands. But compared to the traditional style of in-ear headphones, the bass was more pronounced and consistent, and the outside noises more muted. The only complaint I have, is there is no ""left"" or ""right"" markings anywhere on mine. It would be nice to get the stereo image the way it was meant to be heard, but it's by no means a deal breaker.",2,2,0.0044272146,0.06706681,0.9285059

"Owned the Via1535TM for just over a year now, it replaced a Garmin Nuvi that died in about 4-years. Voice recognition is now a highly valued feature to me because it reduces the amount of time spent programming a destination. I simply speak into the Via and we're off, 10-seconds instead of 5-minutes. A great feature and very reliable once you get used to the proceedure. Press the speak symbol, wait for the beep and then state the full address, like an answering machine.The VIA calculates the best route based on distance, the roads posted speed limit, and traffic delays. Allowing its projected desination time to be fairly accurate. The spoken instructions are easy to understand but when a series of turns are complicated I still like to glance at the display. The display contains a lot of information, map, speed limit, car speed, next turn, distance to next turn, distance to traffic delay, length of delay, time, and arrival time.Used Tom Tom's update service 4-times so far without a problem. New maps of North America are about 2-gigs so they take time to download and then install. I usually just let it run in the background. One firmware update this year caused a delay in finding the GPS but that issue was corrected a month later with new firmware. The VIA seems to find the GPS instantly if it is on whenever the vehicle is moving. It gets slower if you turn it off, drive out of town, and then turn it back on. For an even longer delay, take it on a plane to Edmonton, and then turn it on after you land.There are lots of things to like about this unit.",2,2,0.00043832013,0.0026933956,0.9968683

"I needed a new pair of back up earphones.  The Shure EC2s that I had been using had after four years developed a short in the cord.  The Klipsch Custom-2s that I have been using as my main earphones, though only a little over a year old, are showing some serious signs of wear and tear (and with only a one-year warranty not replaceable).  Given the low cost of these Sennheisers (and the excellent history I've had with them since I purchased my first Sennheiser headphones about thirty years ago) I thought getting these as backups was a safe investment.I couldn't be happier.  In fact, given the battered state of my Klipsch earphones, I'm prematurely retiring them and using these Sennheisers.  The sound is about 90% as good as the Klipsch earphones, which cost 8 or 9 times more.  Actually, most of the time the sound is better, since I've always had a great deal of trouble getting the Klipsch earphones to rest properly in my ear, which meant a loss of sound quality.  The Sennheisers are far more comfortable than the Klipsch earphones and I love the much longer cord.  In short, these earphones are a bargain in every sense of the word.I do want to upgrade to a higher quality pair of earphones, but I've been so delighted with these that I'm definitely going to stick with Sennheiser.  I don't know which ones that I am going to get, but I do know that Sennheiser is going to be on the label.  If you are looking for a very good pair of very inexpensive earphones, I couldn't recommend these more strongly.",2,2,0.009165126,0.03180151,0.9590333
"My husband and I were going back and forth for awhile as to whether or not to connect a PC to our TV/Home Theater system, then I heard about the Revue, and we finally decided to move forward with the Revue.  Absolutely LOVE IT!  This is undeniably one of our better ""good use and good value"" purchases.

"I purchased this for a small living room and I am VERY pleased.  Yes, the rear speaker wires weren't long enough.  Most factory sets are like that.  Get a spool of 16ga wire and you'll be fine.Amazon's picture is wrong.  The system I received had all black pieces...no grey.  The remote was different too.  No big deal, and I think the black looks better anyway. - UPDATE 2/4/13: Amazon has since changed the picture.  The system I received is EXACTLY like the one in the picture.Setup was pretty easy.  I followed the directions using the calibration microphone provided in the box, but ended up tuning each speaker to my ear's specifications instead.  I recommend doing this or else you might be disappointed.  I find the factory calibration seems to be on the conservative side.Each speaker (and the sub) can be tweaked from -6.0 to +6.0 signal level for fine-tuning the system to suit anyone's needs.  The only downside to this that I've found so far, is that this can't be done on-the-fly.  It can be done in the Custom setup menu.  You have to stop what you're doing, switch the unit to DVD mode (make sure the disc is stopped) and then tweak as necessary.  A bit of a pain, but once it's set you shouldn't have to mess with it much other than to turn up the sub if you want to shake the plaster off the ceiling.  For those people who stated that this system doesn't allow you to tweak each speaker, you're idiots.  RTFM!  Step-by-step directions are there.That said, this system cranks.  I had to turn the sub down to -4.0 because it was too much.  Not a bad thing I guess.  Grab a digital optical audio cable too.  Much easier (and clearer) than RCA's.  6ft cables are &lt;$10.Unless you're a true audiophile (in which case you probably aren't shopping on Amazon anyway) you won't be disappointed.  If you're on the fence about this system, don't be.  It's a great bang for the buck.",2,2,0.001307083,0.0028356416,0.9958573

Grant's script is derived from one originally on Insanely Mac, and is easy to to revert.

"Magnificent resolution.  For photography, the colors are spot on after calibration (Coloreyes Pro, Spyder 3), and ports are plentiful.  Also (with Windows) run ClearType and inspect it closely with a magnifier.The Samsung variant on IPS is very good but comparing it with an iPad 2 and other IPS screens, it does show a color shift at the widest edges along with backlight bleed-through in the lower corners. This is with my head stationary in the horizontal center of the screen, 3/4 up on the vertical.  It is a pretty minor issue and is not noticeable with normal photographs but is evident with internet browsing and file management.

"I have been an Amazon fan for a long time. My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the ""swipe"" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I ""haunt"" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a ""need"" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.SincerlyR",2,2,0.2736556,0.27422625,0.4521181

This Samsung keyboard dock is bulkier but it's closer to the size of a standard keyboard, so touch typists should feel right at home after a few minutes.  I've never been a fan of the tiny shift key on the right hand side, but I haven't had much of a problem striking this one conistently and accurately.The keys are repsonsive and provide just the right amount of resistance which helps with accuracy.  I really appreciate the dedicated Android keys on the top row, such as the HOME, INTERNET, and MAIL keys.  The audio pass thouugh jack was also well thought out.Onto the negatives.  The dedicated Android keys can't be customized!  The Mail key doesn't open up Gmail!  Really?  This is afterall a dedicated Google device!  Not sure this can be fixed with a mere software update.I occasionally experience a bit of lag while typing.  This boggles my mind mainly because the Tab is making a direct connection with the keyboard! I would expect this type of lag using Bluetooth, but never with a direct connection.  To be fair, I only experienced this lag once upon initial boot up and it hasn't reared it's head again.The lack of a spell checker option is sorely missing!  Now this should be correctable with a software update!Overall I'm very pleased with this dock, and would easily have given it 5 stars were it not for the few issues described above.  It makes the perfect desktop dock, and I like the idea of only pulling out my keyboard when I need it, rather than always having it attached to my carrying case.  This is the best portable keyboard I've used for a tablet,  and I'm sure the next version will be even better.",2,2,0.0018488292,0.020829149,0.97732204
"I bought the GigaWorks T3 setup to replace an aging Klipsch ProMedia speaker system for my computer. The Klipsch's are good speakers with great bass, but they are quite large and heavy. Too big for the apartment I now live in. The small size of the T3's satellites, and compact subwoofer, make it perfect for folks that want big sound in a small package. Sound quality is very good, bordering on exceptional, whether listening to jazz or heavy metal. Bass is very powerful from the subwoofer--quite a feat for such a small unit. Mid-range is about as good as you can get from tiny satellite speakers, not quite as clear as a pair of high-dollar headphones, but the best you're gonna find in a 2.1 setup for a computer. Build-quality seems good with decent cables and solid speaker construction, and the packaging keeps it in one piece. The volume control is a handy puck-shaped object that you can keep near your mousepad for quick access. Only change I would make to this product would be to put a mute switch on the volume control. Overall, I highly recommend the T3's for music-lovers who do their listening through their computers. And, for any gamers out there that want to step-up to better quality sound.",2,2,0.00045710037,0.0021408005,0.9974022
"I bought this mainly because when I checked prices on bluetooth keyboards and tablet stands, they added up to about the price of this dock. Might as well have one item take care of both tasks. The added benefit of some extra USB ports is a nice bonus.The first thing I did after connecting my tablet to this stand was to run the Samsung software updater. It found an update for the dock, applied it, and two restarts later it was done.The instruction manual recommends shutting off the tablet before disconnecting it from the dock, so that might account for the problems other users are having. Just to check, I tried removing the tablet from the dock while it was on and it worked just fine.The keyboard is adequate, but nothing I would use for heavy, long-term typing.I was initially hesitant to buy this due to the price, but after some comparison shopping, it turned out to be a better option than a separate tablet stand and bluetooth keyboard.",2,2,0.05767518,0.3057617,0.63656306

"I'm not much of an audiophile. My ENT says I have the hearing of a teenager, which I'm sure is a veiled insult, but she assures me otherwise. Even so, it's my husband who coos over all things Sennheiser. He has an ancient pair of noise-cancelling on-the-ear Sennheisers and a pair of their CX300 ear buds. Both are very nice and have great range. So when I saw this SENNHEISER MM 80i TRAVEL HEADSET, I was anxious to try them it out.The packaging is functional and compact. The included case prevents the cord from twisting and tangling and is itself crush-resistant. The ear pieces are stylish and very different from those on the CX300. I frequently find anything that goes into my ears uncomfortable, but these babies are very comfy. I've worn them for up to 30 minutes so far with no issues. They come with various size rubber cups and loops for your outer ear, but I haven't needed those. The cable comes in 2 parts so that you can disconnect the section with the control interface, if you don't need it. Everything has a very solid feel to it, including the gold-plated connectors. Oops. Before I finished this review, the internal compartment of the protective case popped off. It doesn't matter to me, but without it, the cords can more easily become tangled.In action, the SENNHEISER MM 80i TRAVEL HEADSET works exactly as expected. Not much to say about that. The control interface has volume up/down and call answer/hangup. On my iPhone, these functioned flawlessly. And the sound quality on the calls was wonderful on both ends. Normally, I'd end the review here, but I do want to add a word of caution.I also tried the SENNHEISER MM 80i TRAVEL HEADSET on other devices, including an iPad 1 and a Dell Vostro V13 Laptop. They simply did not work on the iPad 1. No sound at all. The volume controls moved the on-screen volume slider, but I only ever heard a soft hiss. Now, the hiss did increase and decrease in volume based on my pushing the controls, but that was it. On the Vostro, I did get very nice sound, but the Sennheiser volume controls didn't work. If I removed the controls, then the ear buds were great (if very short) but with the controls in, I had to pull the jack out a bit to get the right channel to play.This is why I said the SENNHEISER MM 80i TRAVEL HEADSET is wonderful but with caveats. They seem to function as advertised on the iPhone, but on devices that don't need the microphone, performance is very strange.",2,2,0.0009081326,0.0052093845,0.99388254

"Small, medium, or large - the descriptions on the box and about this product leave a lot to be desired. If you use the right size, these holders work nicely.Medium is for most USB cables. The iPod/iPhone/iPad cable, a three foot USB cable, or the Kindle micro USB cable is perfect for the Medium size holder. The picture on the package for the small shows the Apple iPod cable, that doesn't work at all; the medium holder is required.These clips / holders are made of soft matte finish silicone. They feel very nice in my hand. They are a pretty good stress ball when not in use, they're kind of fun to squeeze. The clip relies in the cables sliding inside a groove on both sides. The clip expands pretty easily to accept a wire loop or two at a time.I was wrapping these cables in a lop and then twisting the wire back through the opening, like an extension cord. Unfortunately, this is really hard on the wires, and will ultimately destroy my cables. I have a big pencil holder on my desk where I throw all these cables, regular USB, Micro USB, and iPod. It's hard to keep those cable organized or grab them easily. These clips make that job much easier now.I like these clips. The colors are not the coolest. But they are functional. I wouldn't bother with Velcro around these short cables.For headphones (the cheap ones from Apple or Sony) use the small clips. I can see how these would be disappointing for 110V electric wires - even the large is not sturdy enough for that job. I think the large version is a bad idea. The small and medium work great for short cables.Bluelounge Small Multi Purpose Cable Clips CC-SM",2,2,0.0029887303,0.023975538,0.9730357

"POSITIVE:I like many, have been an avid Nvidia user, and was very skeptical when purchasing this card, due to previous versions before ATI was taken over by AMD. Furthermore, I was looking for a card that offered balance between average use, and heavy gaming graphics, but for a reasonable price.In addition, I was also concerned about the fan noise, which with my previous Nvidia Geforce 9800, it was so loud at times i was ready to use just about anything other than, and ran at about 60-65 Degrees Celsius, possibly because it was old and ready to die out. Therefore, I needed a card fast.By comparison, Sapphire Radeon Cards fan suprisingly runs extremely quiet. Also, I noticed a significant difference immediately with quality graphics in games, most of which I play are heavy graphic based. I havent benchmarked the item as of yet, although, through Windows 7 Performance Ratings it went from 3.7 to 5.2 with this card. Drivers are easily downloaded, overclocking is an option like most, and it runs at a cool consistant 45-50 degrees Celsius. Also, it is Crossfire ready if desired.NEGATIVE:The only downfall that I must mention is the size of the fan taking up two ports. Therefore, anyone wanting to purchase this card must keep that in mind. Also, it comes with a DVI output as opposed to S-Video which I will need to purchase the correct adapter, running from DVI to S-Video in the back of my TV. Not a problem, just an inconvenience temporarily.CONCLUSION:Final conclusion: Excellent card for the price, good for gaming, runs cool, and an awesome alternative for those who wish to break away from Nvidia, especially knowing that AMD is behind the product, you most definitely will not be dissapointed. However, if so, you would be one of a very select few. You won't find a better card for the price.",2,2,0.033426195,0.12929915,0.8372747

"I ordered the TV Sat night and received it Tue afternoon(with free shipping). Thanks Amazon !!! Setup was easy but as one reviewer pointed out screwing in the base/stand can be frustrating if you don't have a thin long screwdriver possibly with a magnetic tip to prevent the screw from falling in the hole sideways. I used chopsticks after the first screw to place it in!!I hooked it up to my verizon cable box (not HD), DVD player and a PC. The picture quality is very good especially the movie channels( although I can only compare to an old tube TV that I was replacing).  The audio is ok, nothing to get too excited about. I have a surround audio receiver that I use so that is not a big deal for me.  It has tons of settings for picture adjustment. All my connections are analog but I am happy with the picture quality. I popped in the Dark Knight dvd and it's never looked better. The blacks aren't as dark as you would see in a plasma but for an entry level LCD I wasn't expecting too much. I like that there is not much glare on the screen even with all lights on in the room. It works great as a monitor for my spare PC too. Being an LCD the viewing angle is limited for a perfect picture. Its not 178 as advertised. More like 150 but most people don't watch from that angle anyway. Overall I would recommend it.",2,2,0.0027640178,0.05184487,0.94539106

"I've owned and used this lens, on a professional/working basis, for nearly three years.  I must say, these reviews gave me a good chuckle.A bit about me as a photographer.. I've owned Canon 10Ds and 20Ds, 5Ds and 1Ds.  I currently shoot with a 1D Mark IV, 5D Mark II, and yes, I keep around a 40D because 1) They are great cameras and 2) They go places I don't want to take my other bodies.  To keep that 40D doing everything I want while packing light, I need one or two lenses that ""do it all.""My choice for those two lenses are the 17-55 2.8 IS and something else, usually an 85 or 135 prime.Materials: For a plastic-bodied lens, Canon did a good job with this one.  I really have no complaints, and when handling the lens, I don't personally feel as though I'm using an inferior product.  By contrast, I also shoot with various L lenses including 35mm 1.4L, 85mm 1.2L, 70-200mm 2.8L, and 300mm 2.8L.  The focus and zoom rings are smooth and accurate, the switches stay where you put them, the body is resistant to scratches and scuffs.  For the price I am very happy with the materials used.Construction: Again, good materials and solid construction.  No rattles, no creep of the zoom when I angle the thing down while hiking or moving around (although that might be just my copy).  Three years of hard use and everything fits tight and works the way it did when new.  The 77mm thread size is great, I can share filters with my L lenses as needed, saves a bit of money there.  Also, the front element is fixed, doesn't rotate, so you can use a circular polarizer.Sealing: For a non-L lens, I am actually impressed by how well sealed this lens is.  It might be that the 40D fit is a bit better than the Rebel or other lower-end bodies, but on the 40D the seal is excellent.  I've had the rig out in heavy downpour, blowing rain, salt water, and haven't noticed any moisture creeping into the sensor box, rear lens, or lens body.Handling: This is a comfortable lens to use, not too heavy and good size/balance overall.  The plastic body makes it a bit lighter than the heavier L lenses, so it is more balanced on a plastic-body Rebel or 40/50D, or even on a 7D (which I've never used for more than a few minutes so I can't speak directly to that).  I am a bigger guy, but a smaller person should have no problem hiking with this lens all day around their neck.  The 2.8 aperture provides a very bright viewfinder compared to say the f/4-5.6 kit lens for wide-zoom f/4L options.Color/Saturation/Conrast: Really superb all around.  Here's a quote from Canon:""By optimising Super Spectra lens coatings and lens element shaping, Canon's engineers have been effective in suppressing flare and ghosting  more prone to occur with digital cameras due to reflection off the image sensor. By increasing light absorption, coatings reduce reflections off lens element surfaces to deliver crisp, undistorted images with natural colour balance.""There's a bit of flare with this lens, I can't necessarily agree with that point (although no more than to be expected in a wider-angle lens, and easily mitigated with the lens hood or by not shooting into the sun).  Being a more modern lens, and using UD (ultra low dispersion) lens elements (just like those fancy red-ring lenses), the optical quality of this lens can (in the hands of the right photographer) exceed that of legacy L-glass.Sharpness: f/4 to f/8 is the sweetspot for most lenses, and the same is true for this one.  If you're the type that spends hours peeping at ISO charts, this review isn't for you.  This lens is sharp at 2.8, especially outside of a meter or so, edge to edge and corner to corner.  Crop sensors have an advantage in this arena.  Inside a meter, the sharpness is acceptible but not ideal.  Hey, a lens can't do everything well.  For landscape, at say 30mm and f/8, this lens will blow your mind, especially if you're moving up from a kit lens.  If you're using a flash for events, then anywhere in the zoom range (except the extremes) at 2.8 is totally printable up to 16"" on a long side, with only 8MP resolution sensor.  Put your camera in Av and have fun.  Again, if you're a chart person, you'll be able to find some distortion, edge blurryness, things of that nature, all totally correctible by either stopping down a bit, or a few keystrokes in post if you're that hardcore.  For the average user, hobbyist, working professional, none of these things are show stoppers.  You'll probably never notice.The aperture is a circular 7-blade affair, produces high quality bokeh especially for closer subjects.Focusing/AF: Not as fast as the 70-200 but close.  If you know how to use your AF it's as fast as you need it to be for the types of subjects and scenes this lens is probably going to be used for.  Being a 2.8 lens, you'll be getting the most out of your cross-type AF points, even when not at f/2.8.  Tips: Manually select your AF point, and get that point over a high contrast area.IS: At first I was skeptical of putting IS on a lens with a maximum focal length of 55mm.  If you can't handhold at that distance, you need to seriously think about your photography technique and maybe take a lesson or two.  That said, with the 3-stop IS I can hand-hold for 2-seconds with this thing and still get a very good image.  For those not familiar with IS, IS will not stop fast moving subjects.  IS is a tool to help you reduce camera shake, especially during longer exposures (slower than 1/30sec) in low light.  If you're shooting action, there's almost no reason to have IS on other than to drain your batteries faster (and if you're shooting action professionally, 1) you know when to use IS and why, and 2) you aren't doing it with this lens, so I won't go into it any deeper here).  This IS is useful but know how it works and don't just leave it on all the time to get the most benefit.Vignetting: Some people see vignetting as a negative, a flaw from design or a compromise.  I see it another way, as a creative tool.  There are a set of conditions that have to be selected to get a lens to vignette on a particular body.  If a creative photographer wants light falloff, then they set up to create that effect.  If they don't, then they find another combination of settings.  Being able to force vignette is a feature.""The dust issue"" This is the one that really made me laugh.  Yea I have dust on the inside of my objective glass.  Probably 12 or 15 specs, some of them fairly big like a grain of salt.  How they got in, I have no idea.  I don't use filter glass on the front to protect it, so maybe it came in the front but I doubt it.  Maybe it came in between the rings, or was ground up plastic from the internal mechanisms, or maybe something else.  I know one or two of them are ""genuine Canon factory dust"" because they were there when I unboxed the lens.  Am I worried?  Not in the least.  I've never noticed image degradation from those specs, and probably never will.  If I do, I'll send it to Canon for cleaning, as I do with my bodies every couple years.  It's worth the small investment.  Many photographers overstress the issue of dust or scratches or fingerprints on the objective glass, seriously, it has minimal if any impact.  What's much more important is keeping the back glass clean and clear.  Dust?  Non-issue for me, and it should be for you too.How could Canon improve this lens?  Metal body, red ring, better sealing, probably some minor motor tweaks to make it faster/quieter, include the soft pounch and hood.  How would that impact the price?  Probably $500-750.  Would it be worth $1500 to buy a lens that covers 17-55mm on a Rebel or a 40/50D 1.6x body?  No, I don't think so.  This lens is a bit of compromise, but let's remember the people it's aimed at.. serious hobbyists/amateurs, low-level professionals.  Somebody who has a prosumer level SLR and is ready to spend some bucks to get a really sweet lens, but isn't going to 1) shell out $2000 for a top of the line body nor 2) use/abuse their kit the way a professional would.  So Canon left out some of those really high-end features that would only bloat the price with minimal benefit.  I think it's a good decision overall.  The people who want better will wait for the mythical 24-70 2.8L II with 4-stop IS that might be coming out in Fall.  Er, next year.  Oh, maybe in 2 years.Negatives... well, one negative is a really weak magnification factor (0.17x at 55mm).  If you're looking to take macro shots, or product shots, this lens really isn't going to do it for you.  If that's your thing, money is probably better spent on the 60mm macro, which is also a really good portrait lens.  I really can't think of any more negatives to this lens.Finally.. resale value of this lens has remained strong, despite what many have said.  This is a great 2nd lens for the relative beginner, as well as being a great ""standby"" for a working professional.  If all else were to fail, get lost in shipping, not be available, whatever, I grab my 40D and 17-55 to get the job done.",2,2,0.0031137385,0.014325792,0.98256046
"I recently got my hands on one of these, I loved it so much I had to buy it.  The bokeh is amazing, I find the lens reasonably fast to focues.  And speed, talk about speed, you can really cut down on the noise by shooting a f1.2 and lowering you ISO speed.  One serious note, the plane of focus is not flat, it takes some getting used to to shoot with.  Also, I highly recommend using AFMA software to ajust focus for f/1.2.",2,2,0.00031069465,0.0014336457,0.99825567

"I have had a good experience with the munki in calibrating my NEC SpectraView monitor and Epson R1900 printer so that what I see on the screen is what prints- voila. The zipper failed on the pouch that holds the munki and xrite immediately sent a replacement at no charge and they were very nice about it- contra to some who have said they have a bad attitude. The Munki also worked beautifully with the NEC SpectraView II software for my photo monitor but at the moment there is an issue with Windows 7 when switching between X-Rite software and SpectraView II. My support experience with them has been very good. What some people may be experiencing is the complexities of color profiling because of the interfacing of other devices like printers and monitors. As noted by others this is not a simple process even if the Munki works perfectly. Incorrect settings in your other devices/software can cause all kinds of issues that are hard to track down. The only annoyance is that you have to go to Control Panel and Devices to disable ""X-Rite Services (uncheck the box) in order for SpectraView to recognize the Munki in Windows 7. Then all works great until you want to use the X-Rite software again to profile the printer. I don't know whether NEC or X-Rite is at fault here but they ought to get together. Then using the X-Rite software for profiling my printer and SpectraView to profile the monitor would be a simpler process to go back and forth. Obviously if you don't have a NEC monitor or Spectraview this is a non-issue. Great product and would buy again. A real value too!",2,2,0.0026468681,0.013230303,0.9841229

There are instances where it came useful but it's not very comfortable for longer duration use.The 4 different angle (3 grooves and the one lock/tab) allow for multiple viewing angles. Flip it around and you can lock the tab with the included rubber-band-ish  mechanism to prevent the cover from falling over.

"I was looking forward to a nice set of ear phones that would stay in my ear, fit great, not annoy me, and offer decent audio quality while I'm out running or working out.The phones look great, pretty stylish, the audio quality is decent, however it fails on the whole ""stay in my ear and not annoy me front"".Not sure why, but they fit perfectly in my left ear, but they wont stay in my right ear for no more than a minute at most causing constant interruptions.I was trying these out while doing some plyometric training last saturday (jumping, going down on the floor, getting back up, kicking, etc) and the headphones did NOT fall off my ear (even though my ear was incredibly wet with sweat).However, the actual ear piece that goes in your ear would NOT stay in on my right ear (the left stayed much longer, but it eventually fell out after a while).This would not be such a bad thing, but the ear piece falls out way to fast.I tried listening to my ipod at home with the phones and the same thing happened here, the right ear just falls out.Maybe there is just a quality issue involved here, I'm not sure, but all in all these phones could be better.  If the ear piece just stayed in for 10 minutes, they would of gotten 5 stars.I don't think anyone would buy these phones just to listen to music, the goal is for them to stay in your ear during an active workout, and on that front these phones fail to measure up (not a complete failure, but I'm sure you can do better).I use another brand of sport headphones that go around the back of your head, and they stay in (but hurt my ear like you wouldn't believe) which is why I was wanting this pair to work.Maybe next time.",2,0,0.5468585,0.4271628,0.02597873

"This is a remarkable monitor; if I could give 6 stars, I would do it. The detail is just perfect. There is no trace of the backlight glow everybody always talks of. It feels like I am looking at paper, not a TV monitor. The glare people talk about is non-existent. The complaints about the coating? There is nothing you can see that is anything like they describe. There were no bad pixels.If you want to, also, turn it into a TV, you can easily do that as well. I just purchased a $39 HDTV HomeWorx with Media USB capability that works amazing. Know that you will have to plug the output from the 3.5mm stereo sound output to another audio amp in order to hear sound from the TV. In my case, I have a second monitor which extends my Desktop which has its own built-in stereo speakers which I use to power the TV's audio and use a larger better-quality set of powered speakers to play the sound from my computer. Works out well that way.Thus, I with an ATI Radeon 6700 card I power this monitor and a second VGA monitor with a VGA to HDMI converter cable (works perfectly with great clarity). Had to do it that way because people on the internet had said this video card doesn't support VGA out to this monitor at the same time as the DVI out... but it DOES allow DVI at the same time as HDMI, which seems to be correct. (I haven't tried coming directly into the VGA input... but it works this way just fine).So, the two things that are lacking on this monitor (if you see what I had to add-on to it to get it to do those things) are a HDTV Tuner and built-in speakers.The monitor? I just love the almost doubled area relative to my old two-17-inch extended LCD monitor system from years ago.Now that I have TWO monitors (extending my desktop to an equivalent 36 inch width x 13 1/3&#34; high) is just remarkable. Now I can do Painter X3 or Photoshop CS6 on this monitor while viewing the instruction book on the smaller monitor.Christine always has problems with monitors. She sees whatever flicker is there as she gets migraines. Even on the old LCD monitor she says she had to shut it off the other day because it &#34;was flickering&#34;. This one? Rock solid to her. Not the slightest trace of flicker.I can't even imagine something I could complain about with this monitor's image quality. It is easy on the eyes. When I look over at the LCD monitor, the color balance over the whole screen varies. It feels far less crisp than this monitor (which is absolutely perfect in its crispness). The uniformity of each pixel throughout the whole area is perfect (just shows the difference between today's technology and the technology from 10 years ago).A remarkable miracle is what I would call this monitor (and I have never said such a thing about any other product I've ever reviewed. I am a stickler who almost always can come up with some complaint (most things aren't perfect).I suppose I would say the connectors on the bottom are hard to get to. It would have been nice if they had placed the audio-out jack on the left along with the USB 3.0 connectors (which I have had no problem with at all under Windows 7 and my computer).One thing nobody ever mentions is a tiny ability to even have horizontal tilting. My computer table has been used for over 15 years, so it sags in the center. That means that most all other monitors have had to be propped-up on the right-hand-side in order for the monitor to look straight. With this monitor, I found that I had a slight ability to tilt the monitor in a counter-clockwise direction (enough so the monitor now looks straight even though I put nothing underneath the right-hand side of the monitor.My bed is right next to the monitor, so I also like how I can pivot the monitor to the left so I can watch movies in bed.In conclusion... here are my comments on the monitor:GOOD:1. Impeccable-quality image-crispness2. Perfect color balance without any need to fiddle to get it right as I've always had to do in the past.3. No backlight glow in any corner.4. No blown pixels.5. Overall rating of 6 stars if it could be given such a thing.BAD:1. No TV Tuner (no Computer Monitor has that anyways)2. No built-in speakers... but you can output the HDMI sound through the audio output so you can adda second amp to hear HDTV if you're using that input for that reason).Incredible monitor.LOVE TO SEE IN FUTURE VERSIONS:1. This exact same monitor in a 32-inch2. A dedicated USB input that would allow an external MicroSD or USB Flash Drive which supports MP3 music, MPG movies and Photos (purchasing the external HDTV HomeWorx box gives that capability to the monitor... but with lessened quality than there would have been if that feature had been built-in).3.

"As a special education teacher I am frequently called upon to record specific student behaviors and classroom activities. In the past I've had to go to the media specialist and check out an unwieldy video recorder and fumble with it and never really get what I need. I have only had this Flip video camera for a few weeks and I have already had cause to use it numerous times. Whenever there is something going on in my classroom that needs to be quickly documented I grab my Flip and start recording with the push of just one button.The quality of my recordings are surprisingly vivid and clear. The sound is much better than one would expect from such a cute little object, and I am able to store up to 2 hours worth of material on it. I am not able to speak much about the technical aspects of it because I am not interested and there is no need for me to stress myself over things I don't need to know. As long as it serves its purpose as a funtional classroom aid I am a happy man.It is so easy to use that I allow my special education students to record things and they LOVE it. They tape each other reading and we watch the videos back together and discuss how their reading could be improved. We taped an Indian Powwow earlier this week and they have watched it repeatedly. The Flip video camera has been an excellent addition to my classroom repertoire. It also serves as an invaluable classroom management tool.

"I've had this camera for a little more than a week now, and have thoroughly run it through the paces, exploring every nuance.  It is an awfully nice camera, with some unusual features.  If it has any weakness at all, it is the initial difficulty with the PC connectivity, which is exacerbated by the poor treatment given to that subject in the manual.  I'll try to explain what's wrong there, and maybe you'll have less difficulty than I had.  But first, I'll tell you a little bit about the distinguishing features of this camera.First off, I like this class of camera, because I feel that it gives you the most important capabilities of a digital SLR, but without the excessive bulk.  I also appreciate the convenience of an automatic lens cap, which is not ordinarily a feature of SLRs.  If what you primarily want is the manual controls that you get with an SLR, then you don't have to buy an SLR to get that, and you can still have a camera that will take excellent pictures.One feature that attracted me to the DSC-V3 is the speed.  It isn't the fastest camera on startup, with roughly 3 seconds from the time that you press the power button until it is ready to take a picture.  Once it is ready to go, it is one fast camera, rivaling the digital SLRs.  It is exceptionally quick to focus when you press the shutter button half way, then the delay from when you press the button all the way until it takes the picture is imperceptible, and finally the delay from when the picture is taken until it is ready to take another picture, is about a second, albeit greater as slow shutter speeds due to the unique approach to noise reduction (which I'll discuss in a moment).  If you wait until you can see the image in the LCD again before pressing the shutter again, you can take 10 pictures in about 15 seconds.  If you put it in burst mode, it will take pictures at a rate of about one picture per second, until you release the button or until the card is full.  Using the ""speed burst"" mode, it takes 8 full-resolution, 7.2 megapixel pictures, in fine jpeg format, in about 3 seconds, but then you have to wait a little while for it to transfer the files from internal memory to the flash memory card.  All of this assumes that you aren't using the flash of course, because anytime that you use a strobe flash with any camera, you have to wait for the capacitor to recharge.By the way, you can use either Compact Flash cards or Sony's Memory Stick.  If you want to shoot movies in the finest format that is available, you have to use Memory Stick Pro.  I wasn't planning to use this camera to shoot movies, but I wanted the inter-shot delay to be as small as possible, and I wanted the wait period after shooting in speed burst to be minimized.  I found myself wondering whether the speed of data transfer from the camera to the memory card would be limited by the camera or the data card.  I bought a Memory Stick Pro card, and did some tests comparing it to a Compact Flash card that I had in an older camera.  The Memory Stick Pro reduced the delays by a significant amount in every shooting mode.  It appears that the delay in every mode is determined primarily by the write speed of the memory card, so if you can find comparative data on the write speed of different categories of Compact Flash and Memory Stick, those numbers should translate directly to the delay between successive pictures and the number of pictures that you can take in a given period of time.Let's see, some of the other distinguishing features of this camera are the Hologram auto-focus assist light, and of course the Night Framing and Night Shot modes.  The Hologram AF assist light uses a low-power laser to project a sharp, fine cross-hatch pattern on the subject.  This works in complete darkness, and although it works better when the subject has some contrast lines of its own, in most cases it will permit the camera to focus instantaneously on a flat wall in a dark room.  It works better in the dark, and the camera will not try to use it if it isn't dark enough, but when the subject distance is great and there is still enough light for the camera to focus using ambient light, you get better results by turning it off.  The manual says that it works to a distance of about 10 feet.  I know from experience that it works at least twice that far, but haven't experimented beyond that.The Night Framing capability lets you use the IR lamp to preview and frame your picture in the darkness, but then using the flash to take the picture, so that you get a normal picture with the flash instead of the monochromatic, greenish image that you get in Night Shot mode, which disables the flash and uses the IR to capture the image.  The IR lamp built into the camera is not very strong, and doesn't work well beyond 10 feet or so.  In fact, Night Shot mode is really only practical when used with a tripod, due to the slow shutter speeds needed with the dim IR light.  If you bought a separate IR light, you could probably do some serious IR photography at night, and with the help of an IR-pass filter, you could possibly do daylight IR photography, although that would be hampered somewhat by the fact that the IR modes are only available in the camera modes where the camera has full control of both shutter speed and aperture.  (The IR-blocking filter that normally shields the sensor from IR, is moved out of the way in these modes.  It isn't clear to me whether attempting to use these modes in the daylight could damage the camera, but at the least you won't get a correct exposure in Night Shot mode, since the metering seems to apply a special correction factor to compensate for the sensor's sensitivity to IR, and this throws off the exposure whenever the amount of ambient full-spectrum light overwhelms the amount of IR.)Three metering modes are available, and three focusing methods are available.  With the Flexible Frame focusing method, the focusing frame is small and you can position it wherever you like in the LCD, to focus on a subject not in the center of the frame.  You can't do the same thing with the metering, but you can use spot metering in conjunction with the exposure lock button.  That is, you first aim the camera where you want the metering to be peformed using spot metering, then press (and release) the AE lock button, then re-frame the image, and then focus using the Flexible Frame positioned where you like, or use one of the other two focusing methods, or set the focus to a preset distance.  While that much flexibility is available, in most scenarios where you want the metering and the focusing to apply to the same subject area that happens to be off center, you would leave the Flexible Frame in the center of the LCD, then aim the camera at the small subject area of interest and press the shutter button half way to lock both the exposure and the focus, then reframe the image and zoom as desired before pressing the shutter button the rest of the way.The AE lock button is located above the LCD, as are the two buttons that you use to control the focusing method, and the exposure compensation button.  The four-way navigation buttons are overloaded, as is the norm, so that when you haven't pressed the menu button or done something else to change the function of those buttons, those four buttons are used for selection of the flash mode, macro mode, self-timer, and quick review of the last picture taken.By the way, the quick review feature only works for the last picture you took.  To review other pictures and movies, or to resize them, delete them, protect them from deletion, rotate them, etc., you turn the mode dial on top of the camera to the ""Play"" position.  Some users will find this inconvenient and will wonder why the quick review button doesn't take you to this mode, and why there even is a ""Play"" position on the mode dial.  Regardless, the quick review feature is at least useful for zooming/magnifying the last picture that you took, to see whether it was in focus.The button that selects Night Framing, Night Shot, or normal, is on top of the camera, next to the power button and the mode dial.  The back of the camera also has dedicated buttons for selecting the recorded image size (which functions as the delete button during quick review and the Play position of the Mode dial), for accessing the menus, and for selecting the LCD mode.The zoom contol (rocker) is on the back, up high near where your thumb rests.  It is perhaps not as high as you'd like, and part of the reason for that is that between the zoom control and the mode dial, there is a little thumb wheel that protrudes edge-wise, which you spin with your thumb to select the shutter speed, aperture, program shift, and exposure compensation value, according to the mode that you have selected of course.  The only capture mode in which the jog dial isn't used is the fully automatic mode, where the camera is in total control of the exposure settings.  The jog dial is functional and easy to use whenever you select the program shift mode (P), the shutter priority mode (S), the aperture priority mode (A), or the manual mode (M).You use the menus for settings such as the metering mode, record mode (normal, burst, bracketing, TIFF, etc.) white balance, ISO (sensor sensitivity), scene mode selection (twilight, portrait, etc.), jpeg quality factor, etc.  For these sorts of menu selections, you make your selection simply by navigating using the 4-way buttons, i.e., without pressing the center button to confirm your selection.  For the menus that you access in play mode, which you use to edit and delete images, rotate them, etc., it is different in that you use the center navigation button to confirm your actions, so there is little chance to screw up.  I especially like the way you access the setup screens through a special position of the mode dial, as opposed to entering it through the menu as you do on many cameras (which makes the menus more cluttered and less intuitive).I should say something about the auto-focusing mode, which is not the same thing as the AF method.  You select the AF mode via the setup screen, and you can set it to Single, in which case the camera only attempts to focus when you press the shutter button half way, and then it locks the focus along with the exposure controls.  You can also select Monitor, in which case the camera maintains a useful degree of focus as you move the camera around, which shortens the time that it takes the camera to focus even more and avoids the need to press the shutter button half way when all you want to do is check the framing.  In Monitor AF mode, the focus still locks when you press the shutter button half way, so you can have this nice feature yet still be able to lock the focus and then reframe the image.  Continuous AF mode is like Monitor AF up until you press the shutter button half way.  In Continuous AF mode, the focus doesn't lock along with the exposure controls, but instead it continues to focus right up until the shutter is released, which is useful when the distance between you and the subject is changing rapidly.Uh oh, there is still one more feature that I need to tell you about.  One of the limitations of digital cameras in general is that the sensors all have a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), which becomes worse as the sensitivity is increased, i.e., at higher ISO, the noise is worse.  But the noise also gets worse as the shutter speed decreases.  The DSC-V3 uses an interesting technique to reduce sensor noise at slower shutter speeds.  Immediately after the shutter is closed when an image has been captured at a slow shutter speed, the shutter remains closed and another ""picture"" is taken, with the shutter closed, for the same duration of time.  That ""picture"" is subtracted from the captured image, to cancel the noise.  It doesn't work miracles, but it definitely is effective, and definitely improves the quality of images taken at low light and slow shutter speeds, especially at higher ISO settings.Before moving on to talk about PC connectivity, there is still one more thing that I need to talk about.  On a couple of the popular (and highly informative) web sites that review cameras, they point out the reduced sharpness of the image that occurs at smaller apertures such as F8.  They did this in a way that can cause the reader to misunderstand how this concern applies to the DSC-V3 differently from similar cameras.  The reason that this happens is that some amount of light that enters the lens will strike the edge of the aperture and will be diffracted.  If that quantity of light is significant relative to the quantity of light that reaches the sensor cleanly refracted by the lens, the image will be less sharp.  Aperture diffraction is a well-known physical phenomenon of waves in general, and anyone who has a general knowledge of optical systems will tell you that when the quality of an optical system is ""diffraction-limited"", this is the best possible scenario for that system, since if the quality is not limited by aperture diffraction, it is limited by something else that should have been avoided.  The only way that the DSC-V3 can be any different in this respect is if, in the full automatic mode, in bright daylight it uses an aperture that is smaller than is necessary, instead of using a faster shutter speed.  In full automatic mode, the DSC-V3 will go to F4.0 at 1/250 s, and then will decrease the aperture in small steps and won't increase the shutter speed to 1/500 s until the aperture has reached F8.  I don't know how this compares to other similar cameras, but regardless it doesn't matter much to me because whatever difference there is between this camera and other similar cameras will only be in whether the other camera avoids F8 until the shutter speed has been increased to 1/500 s or perhaps 1/1000 s.  The only way that you can avoid this effect with any camera is to understand it and take control.  This is but one of the various reasons why a camera might not take as good a picture in full automatic mode that it would take if the photographer intervenes, and hardly deserves to be brought to anyone's attention unless every other possible failure that can occur in the full automatic mode is discussed as well, and that could take a very long time.Darn it! I forgot to tell you about Smart Zoom ... When you select a recorded picture size smaller than the full sensor resolution (as you might if your memory card is nearly full), Smart Zoom lets you use digital zoom, but doesn't let you zoom past the point where the number of sensor pixels remaining will be less than the number of pixels in the recorded image size.  As long as you have plenty of space on your memory card, you probably wouldn't want to select a picture size smaller than 7 Megapixel, but if you did, you'd probably like to be able to use the digital zoom if only you could be confident that you hadn't zoomed past the point where the number of pixels that remain after the sensor cropping is less that the number of pixels that you are going to record.  Smart zoom is nice in that respect, but of course if you never use a picture size smaller than the full 7 megapixel, then it is entirely the same as disabling the digital zoom.I've told you a lot about the camera, and now I'm going to tell you about the PC connectivity side of things, which is very important for digital cameras.Getting the camera to connect to the PC via the USB port was a piece of cake, as is the norm with USB interfaces.  But I did not find the Picture Package application intuitive, and I was irritated by the fact that the installation set it up with two icons in the system tray, and even worse, an application that is started automatically when the PC is booted.  I called Sony more to express my displeasure with this than to actually solicit help, but for Picture Package issues, they point you to the company that makes it, Pixela.  Pixela's tech support people were very helpful.  I didn't mind the application launching as soon as I connected the camera, but I didn't want it to immediately start copying the images from the camera, and I certainly didn't want it to copy the images that it had already copied the previous time that I connected it.With Picture Package, you cannnot pick and choose individual pictures that you want to download, but you can make configurations settings that will determine whether or not the download starts automatically when the application is started, and whether or not images that it has already copied will be copied again, and whether or not the images on the camera will be deleted after being copied to the PC.  The ability to avoid copying pictures that have already been copied, turns out to be very smart.  You can make selections that influence what Picture Package looks at to determine whether a picture on the camera already exists on the PC.  (It doesn't attempt to keep a log on the PC, which would inevitably get screwed up.)  Each time that Picture Package copies files to the PC, it creates a new folder that is located under a folder that corresponds to the date that the copy is performed (creating that folder the first time that you perform a copy on a given day), and with that folder, there are sub-folders that parallel the folders that you have created in the memory card in the camera.  When you capture a picture in TIFF or RAW mode in the camera, a jpeg is recorded in parallel, and when these two files are copied to the PC, Picture Package gives them the same name, differing only in the suffix.  To determine whether a given picture already exists on the PC, Picture Package compares the EXIF data in the jpeg files in the Picture Package folder on the PC, e.g., the date and time that the picture was taken, and the size.  If you want, you can even tell it to compare the images, which I assume is a byte-by-byte comparison of the two files, but as long as the EXIF data is intact and correct, that seems unnecessary.I blame the user manual for the initial difficulty that I had with Picture Package.  The instructions for Windows users endeavors to distinuish between Windows XP and other versions of Windows.  The essential fact that underlies this distinction, which is not made in the least bit clear in the manual, is that if you use Windows XP, the instructions that apply to you, apply not to the installation of Picture Package, but to how you can use the Scanner and Camera Wizard instead.  This distinction is important from several standpoints, including that a different USB mode setting is needed in the camera, depending on whether you use that Wizard or use Picture Package.  The only place where there is a meaningful mention of the difference in the Normal and PTP modes of the USB port is in the table toward the back of the manual, that summarizes the various Menu settings and settings in the Setup screen, but even there, it isn't at all clear that one setting is for Picture Package and the other is for the Scanner and Camera Wizard of Windows XP.  The worst offense in the manual, however, is where on the page that talks about connecting the camera to the computer, in small print there is a note that says that if you have Windows XP, to skip forward 2 pages.  Immediately following that note there is a picture of the LCD showing that USB normal mode is selected, but nowhere is there a similar picture for Windows XP, and because that picture and the text that goes with it is indented under the advisory comment for XP users, you wonder if it is supposed to apply to XP users.  After you skip forward two pages to where the XP-specific stuff is, which talks about using the XP wizard, you flow without interruption directly into a section that talks about the folder structure on the PC.  There is absolutely nothing that suggests that this only pertains to Picture Package and does not apply if you use the XP wizard method.  That is particularly unfortunate, because it obscures an important distinction between Picture Package and the XP wizard.  If you use the XP wizard, things may be simpler at first, because you don't have to figure out how to configure Picture Package, but you won't get Picture Package's smart folder structure on the PC, or the naming scheme that logically binds the RAW or TIFF file with the corresponding jpeg file that has the EXIF data.  If you have Windows XP and prefer not to use the XP method, you can use the Picture Package method just as easily as users of other versions of Windows.  If you have Windows XP, I will advise you to ignore the instructions that are specific XP users, and follow the other Windows instructions instead.  It may take you a little while to figure out to get Picture Package to not start copying files as soon as it is started, and to not copy the same files over again when it is connected, but once you have that straightened out, Picture Package is a vast improvement over the Windows XP Scanner and Camera Wizard.Not that Picture Package is perfect.  In the thumbnail view, Picture Package doesn't show the file name suffix, so until you learn that the first of two files that have the same name is the jpeg, you have a 50/50 chance of being able to see the EXIF data when you double-click on one of those two thumbnails to open the single-image view for that file.  It would be nice if you could see the EXIF data in the thumbmail view, and it would be nice if you could even do that for the RAW/TIFF image, since it wouldn't be that hard for Picture Package to read the content of the file that has the same name as the RAW/TIFF file except that the suffix is different.I played around with RAW files using Picture Package, but found it not well suited to working with RAW files.  If you really want to work with RAW files, which have the data as it was taken from the sensor but before the procesing that applies white balance, saturation, color, sharpness, and contrast adjustments that you have set in the camera, you need to install the other CD, which has the Image Data Converter application.  Picture Package will let you view RAW files, and make a couple of basic corrections, but it is painstakingly slow and crude.  The adjustment that is labeled ""exposure compensation"", by the way, is not the same thing as doing exposure compensation on the camera.  If you really want to work with RAW files, I would advise installing the second CD right off the bat and not using Picture Package for anything more that copying the files and viewing them only in the thumbnail view.The DSC-V3 is an excellent camera.  When you count the number of unique features, that are not found on other cameras of this class, which bridges the gap between compact digital cameras and DSLR cameras, you wonder why it is that you can have this much more for the same price as the others.  The advantage in speed alone is enough to give this camera a competitive edge, but then it also has the Hologram auto-focus light, Night Framing and Night Shot, an effective approach to noise cancellation, and lesser but still useful features such as Smart Zoom.  The size of the camera is nearly perfect, being just big enough to be comfortable when shooting, but no bigger.  It has a large LCD screen that is easy to see in all kinds of light.  It takes excellent pictures.  And if all that isn't enough, it's a very handsome camera!",2,2,0.004427493,0.04611859,0.94945383

The reviews here were good, and for under $9 I figured it was worth a try. It works fine, and I certainly don't treat it gently, so I'm surprised by the reviewers that say it breaks easily. It rides around in my car, sometimes under a briefcase, sometimes carelessly tossed in the back, and sat on at least once. No problems whatsoever yet.",2,2,0.005093218,0.08241775,0.9124891

"I use these batteries in old Nikon FE- and FM-series SLR cameras. They're more convenient than the silver oxide batteries because you only need one larger battery per camera rather than a set of two. You can't just pop them in and out of these cameras in a few seconds as you would with most devices, so anything that reduces the amount of fumbling is a plus. They are fairly small, so I keep my spare battery for each camera in an old film canister with a nickel for opening the battery compartment.The only reason I can't give this five stars is that I haven't actually worn any out yet, so I can't accurately rate their longevity. My cameras are manual focus and only use the battery to power the meter and shutter release, so *any* battery/batteries will last for years in them unless they are defective or used for really, really, heavy shooting. So far, none of the Duracell lithium batteries I've bought since around 2006 have leaked or had other issues.",2,2,0.00051681825,0.0030822377,0.99640095

"So I wasn't sure what I'd think about behind the head headphones for gaming.  I've used other behind the heads in the past for music and didn't care for them much, but since I like the concept and needed a new pair of PC gaming headphones/mic, I thought I'd give them a shot.  The price range was just where I needed it to be, and my experience so far has been really positive.  I've used them for about a month or two at this point both for PC gaming and PC movies/music.  I've worn them for periods as long as 3 or 4 hours straight with good success.  For that length of time they aren't as comfortable as my old over the ears, but neither are they so uncomfortable as to cause me problems.

"You will notice that I have the same review on the Pyle headrests. The reason for this is because I purchased both the Pyle headrests and the Tview headrests for 2 cars. The Pyle headrests matched my Toyota but not my Honda so I had to buy the Tview headrests to match the color of my Honda. Basically the headrests are the same. Same installation and the instructions look the same too. I wonder if it's the same manufacturer for both brands. The big plus for the Tview headrests is that the headrest doesn't sit back too far. So I didn't need to buy any headrest pillows. The Pyle headrests sit back really far so I did have to buy the headrest pillows.The big plus for the Pyle is that there is a volume control. It's not the loudest when driving but convenient for listening when the car is in park. The thing that puzzles me is that the Tview headrests do have audio cables but there is no volume control. I wonder if the audio cables are for IR headphones. I purchased some XO vision headphones but it didn't work for the Tview. It works on the Pyle though. I have my audio running through the auxiliary in my car anyways so not a deal breaker for me.I am very happy with this purchase. I've been looking for something to keep my toddler entertained for the car rides and this does the trick. I first tried a Coby Tablet and attached it to the headrest but the startup time on the Coby Tablet was just too long and the resistive touch screen is just too hard to get used to once you get used to a capacitive touch screen but anyways, getting off on a tangent here. I am currently using an iPod Touch with this and it works great, I'm just wondering if it would be more cost efficient to buy a more expensive headrest with a DVD player. I'll explain the costs associated with this product and you can make the decision.Installation was very easy. I am an average-knowledge techie. You do have to run the cable through your car seat. I installed this in two cars. In my Toyota, the cable just fell through to the bottom, no problem whatsoever. In my Honda, there is some obstruction so I did have to remove the back plating to the car seat. Overall, not much of a problem, but be prepared to do some work getting that cable to run through the car seat. You do have to buy an adapter to connect the power to your car. It comes with two wires, red and black, you can either connect it directly to your car's electrical (too complicated for me, I chose the easier route) or buy a Enercell(tm) 12V/10A Solderless Vehicle Adapter Plug from Radioshack for $6 to connect it to your cigarette charger. Connecting the wires to this adapter is easy, it just takes some trial and error. Sometimes I had the wires in too far or not far enough. I tested it before I installed it in the car. I recommend you do the same so you won't be playing with the wires in a cramped space under the car seat. The last thing I did was to cover all of the wires with black electrical tape, not absolutely necessary, but I did it just to add additional protection on the wires.Additional Costs.-2 car charger adapters from RadioShack for $12 ($6 each) as noted above-Electrical tape for $1-A 3 port car charger adapter, the device that turns your cigarette lighter into 3 ports. The cord has to be long enough to run to the bottom of your seat. This costs anywhere from $10-20 purchased here on Amazon or at Fry's electronics. You need 1 port for each monitor and another port for your video device.-Three 1 female to 2 male y composite splitters so that your video source can show on both monitors. At RadioShack, each splitter can cost about $8, on eBay, all 3 splitters will be about $8.-iPod Touch 4G 8GB for $200. I'm sure a portable DVD player with video out would work too but I like the Touch because I can control it easier while driving. Surprisingly, the Touch is the only device I can find with composite out. Most devices these days only have hdmi out. I did consider buying the older Touch models such as 2G or 3G but I use the Azul App on the Touch and it only supports the 4G model.-Composite cable for iPod Touch for about $20 on eBay, Apple brand is about $30 I think. Just make sure it supports your iPod Touch. I found that only specific ones support the 4G Touch.-USB car charger adapter for about $6-10. For the iPod Touch, the composite cable also acts as a USB charger so I had to buy this USB car charger adapter. I know some of the 3 port car chargers have USB ports already so of course you won't need this if it does have the USB ports.As you can see, there are alot of additional costs associated with these headrest monitors. Probably about $30-45 to install the headrest monitors and another $225-$240 for the video device. So it might be better to buy the more expensive headrest monitor with the DVD player already included. The reason I didn't do this was because based on alot of the reviews on Amazon, the lower priced DVD headrest monitors had a lot of problems. Most of them commented that the DVD players would break over time. Also I prefer the iPod Touch because I have alot of avi/mp4 movies that can play directly from the Touch.One more thing I do want to mention is that the cords and adapters are all under the driver car seat and looks like a pile of mess. I'm sure you can buy one of those boxes from RadioShack to hold all of these cables but then that is another cost. I don't mind the mess since it's not visible but I thought I would mention it. I'm sure you can go have it professionally installed but I'm sure it's expensive for something you can do on your own.As mentioned in the second paragraph, I could not get the audio working. I am guessing it needs specific IR headphones. But I have my ipod Touch connected to the auxiliary so no problem here.In conclusion, I do love these headrests. I just thought a buyer would like to know the additional costs associated with them.",2,2,0.01450947,0.056330442,0.9291601

"i was looking for an easy to carry camera with manual/slr features.  so the choice was between this, the canon m9, ricoh capilo gx100, or nikon p5100.  since i wanted as wide an angle lens as possible, but had limited funds, i went with the lx2 (the ricoh goes to 24mm equiv but is significantly more expensive).  my main concern was that, compare to the others, i was losing out in getting a much less ""professional"" camera with poorest image quality in the class.after using the camera for some time, i think i probably made the right decision, although perhaps it would have been worth spending more for a wider lens.  certainly the lx2 was stronger than i expected: the image quality was fine, the build was good, and i have found it very easy to use.image quality (noise) seems to be a big issue with the lx2.  the following comments are probably specific to the way i use the camera (you may want to look on flickr - just search for my name).  in particular, i don't make large prints and i tend to use wide angles (on the other hand, i use available light).in practice, then, i always use iso 100 and see no noise problems.  this may sound crazy, but three camera features make it quite reasonable.  first, the lens is fairly fast (at wide angles), second the image stabilisation is excellent, and third the camera has automatic image bracketing.  so with +/- 1/3 stop bracketing you get three reasonable exposures, which means one should be ok even at ""extreme"" exposure times (like 1/4s).one other issue i was apprehensive about was the lack of a viewfinder.  again this has turned out to be fine in practice - the screen is very good, with a bright mode that is sufficient for chilean sunshine and also an ""angled"" mode (which is bright too) that is surprisingly useful when holding the camera at odd angles.other small points: the 16:9 format sounds like a gimmick but works well in practice (i seem to be saying that a lot!); the lens cap is not as annoying as expected; build is good and, while a bit ""shiny"" (i would have preferred the plainer leica styling) it looks ok and seems to be wearing well.if you understand a manual slr then working the camera is no problem - i hardly ever need to go through menus since all the common controls are available more-or-less directly.  the four buttons on the back arranged in a circle are, when you are using the camera normally, mapped to specific functions, while the most critical parameters, like shutter speed or focus, are controlled via the joystick (left/right to select a function and up/down to adjust - the screen helps you along and it comes to feel quite natural and quick).my main criticisms (apart from wanting 24mm) are common to all in this class: they are a bit bulky to pocket (the lens+cap on the lx2 doubles its thickness) and the fastest aperture is nothing like wide enough for shallow depth of field (especially since min aperture increases with focal length).",2,2,0.054285534,0.23154743,0.714167

"I've been anticipating this item to arrive at my doorstep and finally received it, but then i doubts because it reminded me of my previous experience with the tiffen uv filter. Never the less I went ahead and opened this bad boy up and boy was I happy. First off the packaging was pretty good, no filter rings but hey im not complaining. Then I put this on my lens, look through and bam! No reflections no weird artifacts, no extra glaring, nothing! I felt like I just put an adapter ring on because the glass on this filter is multi coated which blocks those weird elements you get with cheap filters that just act as a lens protector. (By the way, I don't see how using a cheap uv filter would act good for a lens protector if you have a lens cap, a cheap uv filter just seems inconvenient.) So to wrap this up I am giving this filter 5/5 because for such a cheap price you're getting premium quality!I would recommend this to anyone that owns a DSLR.",2,2,0.0032013871,0.008774938,0.98802364

"This is a ""point-and-shoot"" or a fixed-lens digital camera. In some ways, it is almost better than a digital ""single-lens-reflex"" or the kind of camera where you can change lenses. This is because the 50x optical zoom lens on the Powershot goes from a the 35mm equivalent of wide-angle 24mm to telephoto of 1200mm which is a huge range of focal lengths. ( 4.3mm to 215.0mm.) You are going from wide for landscape and group shots to zooming in great distances (wildlife, moon, sports closeups from the stands.)If you want a camera to do everything, and not have to lug equipment, this is light and versatile. A few not-great things--the LCD screen is a lower resolution than I'd like. However the lens is so wide-ranging that if you can only take one, lightweight camera, this is quite the choice. You can get more Megapixels from other models of Powershot like the SX170 and you can get WiFi which this DOESN'T have in other models like the PowerShot SX510 HS. But this is a good choice for quick shots at any distance. Used, these run about two-fifty or three hundred. New, unrefurbished around four-twenty-nine.This is my choice for a grab-and-go and do-all camera, where 12MP of resolution are a good trade-off for lugging a DSLR and all the gear. Plus you're more likely to be able to handhold shots that would require a tripod with heavier cameras--however, I'd add at least a full tripod (like the Ravelli ) for situations where handholding won't work.",2,2,0.001483171,0.018523594,0.9799933
"I wasn't sure what to expect from these earphones after reading all of the bad reviews.  And not just bad reviews... some of these people are pissed off that they spent their money on these things and they weren't worth it.  I mean they were M.A.D!!  So I wanted to check them out for myself... and I did.  Ummmm... to the people that didn't like these earphones... ummmm... are you crazy!?!  Of course it's tongue-in-cheek but these headphones kick monster booty!  Not to get too scientific but here is what I tested them on:iPhone 3G, iPod Shuffle, iPod 80 GB, and HP Laptop using Windows Media Player and iTunes.  I listened to the music from `Gladiator', `Titanic', `National Treasure', T-Pain, Phil Hendrie, Art of Noise, P.M. Dawn, Enya, John Williams, Toni Braxton, Bonnie Rait, Deep Forest, Josh Groban, Babyface, and a host of others.  So I had the chance to hear a lot of different types of genre's and sound ranges.  What I liked about this Turbine HeadPhones (THP) is that I could hear a lot of the background instruments that you normally don't hear.  The bass sound is FANTASTIC!!  At times, when you couldn't adjust it, it was a little overwhelming.  When I used it on my iPod Shuffle the bass was really deep especially on the Hip-Hop songs.When I listened to it on my media player and iTunes and was able to adjust the settings... awwwww man!  The richness of the sounds were almost too good to be true and I loved being able to turn up the sound and hear everything!  I was pretty impressed at how it was wrapped and that they sent you a case and a healthy change of ear buds as well.  They stayed put even while I was running around the kitchen trying to cook and clean at the same time.  Very nice.

"A few points I'd like to share:1. Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal.  I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option.  So far, it's been stable, no drop signal.For price/performance ratio, I think this is a great choice.",2,2,0.00042858216,0.003218707,0.9963528
"I ordered this primarily as a computer monitor with the option of adding TV to it at some point.  It looks great now, but for some reason the default settings on VGA leave you with 'edge enhancement' and no 'auto-off when none of the inputs have a signal', so if you have one of these monitors I recommend a thorough examination of the settings.  Settings are input-specific, so you may find yourself redoing them and, as a definite downside, sometimes things are not adjustable while an input is selected(e.g. backlight has been fixed for some inputs).  To itemize my thoughts, there's the following:Pros:1)Picture in picture lets you have tv in a little box on your monitor - you can e-mail through advertisements without switching back or missing a beat2)Fast refresh rate, 5ms response, 1920x1080, crisp and clean picture, and good color/brightness control options3)""Eco Solution"" screen settings measured at the outlet, mostly white on the screen:-9.5 watts in 'picture off/audio only' mode-26 watts off, bright-21 watts low setting, pretty bright-19 watts medium setting, dimmer-17 watts high setting, even dimmer4)Sleep timer (combines particularly well with picture-off mode on audio-only channels, but see cons #5)5)Settings are saved in whichever picture mode you adjusted them, so you can have a few presets for each input.6)Good price for the quality(particularly good if on sale)7)Tool-free assemblyCons:1)Only one adjustment on the stand; tip the screen back or forward - no height, rotation, or side-tilt.2)Backlight bleed is sometimes apparent at the top and bottom. It seems that this may be related not only to brightness settings but also which input is selected, my thoughts are that the backlight is actually above maximum when you select some inputs which do not let you adjust it.3)Bad default settings including but not limited to edge detect.4)Some settings are not adjustable depending on input5)If your vga input uses sleep mode instead of screen saver the audio pass-through stopsConclusion:  The backlight bleed is often negligible after settings alteration, but definitely helped take off a good portion of one star.  There's nothing else seriously wrong with this monitor and Samsung got a bunch of things right - this was an amazing deal at $220 and 5-star at that price.  In need of a replacement I would still lean towards this if I looked at the $300 range, but this is probably a 4.5-star device when it is in with the other $300 options.Given the choice between the cash and one of these, my older brother looked at this and asked Santa for one of his own.",2,2,0.006418621,0.10087292,0.8927084
"I had a Nikon L110 and the picture quality was blurry and just not clear. BUT THIS CAMERA takes really clear and colorful pictures. A friend of mine had this camera and when I saw the pictures, I was very impressed.  So, guess what I decided to get rid of my Nikon and purchase this one. I was going to buy it at Sams Club, but they were out of stock. Looked at Wal-mart.com and they were higher priced than at sams, so I looked online at amazon.com it was very reasonable priced with free shipping and next day delivery.  So, I ordered the camera from amazon.com and got my new camera the next day of ordering.  I am very, very pleased with the camera. It is real easy to use, a small child could use this camera. Very simple instructions.  And I was also pleased with amazon.com. Thank you Amazon.com for having such a great website and ordering was easy too.Thanks.

"After reading many reviews of different memory coolers, I had expected some problems with fitting the KHX Fan into my small DELL Vostro 230MT's Mini-Tower case, but there was a plenty of room to clear the CPU cooler and the big, fat ZOTAC GT240 Graphics card, too !! The easy installation was completed in less than 10 minutes -- Although the fans were not silent, they were MUCH more quiet than I had expected.Kingston did a great job on the design, as the whole unit is compact, but just big enough to get the air to where it's needed !! It's easy to assemble, fits just right, and doesn't shake or vibrate at all !!The KHX's mounting brackets will fit your 2-slot, 3-slot, or 4-slot setup with no looseness and/or vibration, and the increased air flow helps to minimize heat buildup throughout the entire case.As for the beauty of the beast -- I guess it's a matter of taste, but I think the well-made unit is also very sharp-looking (just in case your friends should want to inspect your 'puter's innards), with an exciting blue-anodized aluminum body and 4 blue LEDs in each of the two (2) 60-millimeter fans.Some reviewers complained about the LEDs being too bright -- or too tacky -- or too whatever, but I kinda like 'em !! Besides, the Blue LED lites match the existing blue lights on the DELL case, the Asus Monitor, and the  Motorola cable modem. It's like it's color-coordinated, just in case you care !!The Kingston KHX Fan is the perfect compliment to Kingston's HYPERX line of high-performance memory, but since the unit attaches to the memory slot locking tabs and IS NOT in contact with the memory stick, heat spreaders, and/or the mobo, it will work just as well with other brands and types of PC memory. PC Memory Sticks are a standard length, and the KHX Fan is made to fit that length. There should be NO BENDING necessary, so if it looks like you need to bend something to get it to fit -- STEP AWAY and take another look !!After installation of the KHX, both my memory temps and CPU temps were (and still are!) are much cooler than before, the fans are almost silent, and the pretty blue LED lites have a calming effect on my aging psyche.Click on my name to see 2 images of the installed Cooling Fan.Kingston HYPERX Memory and the KHX Fan Combo is just the ticket for cool-running, high-performance, and superior reliability.*** UPDATE *** - 11 June, 2014 -- Over 3 years of every-day use and trouble-free service -- memory is still cool, fans are still quiet.Dell Vostro 230MT* 2.93 Intel Core2 DUO * 4 GB DDR3 1066 * ZOTAC NVidia GT240 GPU* ASUS 23"" HDMI Display * Intel GT1000 PRO N.I.C.* Motorola SB6121 Cable Modem * NETGEAR WNR 3500L Wireless Router* Logitech Wireless Illuminated Keyboard * Logitech M 705 Marathon Mouse* Xonar D2X PCIe Sound Card * Altec-Lansing 3-Spkr.

"Just got this, so I can't speak to durability, but for the price, it's a very nice case.  I am happy with this case, especially for the price.PROS+ The magnetic wake/sleep works reliably when you open and close it.+ The iPad snaps into the case easily and seems very secure.+ The cover doesn't add much weight or bulk.+ All the corners and edges of the iPad are protected by the case.+ All the holes for cables, and camera line up.+ Nice looking (but no, it's not leather).+ At $6, it easily competes for quality with much more expensive covers.CONS- The 'hinge' is not metal; it's just the microfiber and vinyl material fused together, so it wobbles a bit, and I'm not sure how well it'll wear.- You really have to tuck the folded cover in well to get it to not slip out when you prop it up.- like too many of these covers and cases, the inside microfiber sits on the table top when you fold it back to prop it upright or slant it for typing.  That means any grime on the table collects on the microfiber, which is supposed to protect your screen.

"The converter I got as of the time of this review was unbranded in a plain brown box, and a different model than pictured. It is about the same size, but is in a white and black plastic case that might break if accidentally stepped on, and not a black metal case. The audio output is a 3.5 mm stereo jack instead of the separate left and right RCA jacks. The unit did come with the necessary 5V DC universal (110v/220vac) adapter, and a small instruction booklet. I tested it with a Raspberry Pi (which I needed it for in the first place) and a Sony Blu-Ray player as sources, and with two different VGA monitors.The device seems to do its job very well, and translates the capabilities of the analog VGA output device to the HDMI capabilities advertised to the HDMI source. For example when connecting its VGA output to an old 1280x1024 4:3 monitor the device told the HDMI source to send 720p content. When the VGA output was hooked up to a 1920x1080 16:9 device, it requested 1080p. It appears to do this dynamically without having to turn off the power. When playing 16:9 content on an old 4:3 monitor the image is compressed horizontally to fit the narrow screen. The device must be HDCP capable because I've played commercial Blu-Ray disks through it with no problems.The picture quality of the analog VGA out is as expected: not quite as sharp and vibrant as a direct digital HDMI connection, but it is acceptable. The stereo sound is fine. When the supplied DC adapter is disconnected, the sound continues to work, but the output video signal disappears. I wouldn't count on it working from the power provided by an HDMI source.It does exactly what I expected it to do very well, so I'm giving it 5 stars.",2,2,0.00096859195,0.004862657,0.99416876
"This is the second time I have bought this messenger bag. I use it everyday being I'm a hotspot user who walks to coffee shops daily. I tried to find a similar replacement but could not for the: design, features, and price. I like it for the straps being stitched to the bag as well as having a handle too. The strap also has a shoulder padded section that can be removed. Nice looks with a simple medium size snap clip that's simple to open the bag fast as well as close. This bag has a nice front zipper pocket to hold stuff and a rear slot to store magazines. I use this bag to carry either my X201i or X220 ThinkPad laptops with no trouble. Both laptops I use have 9 cell extended batteries installed and fit just enough to still get the Velcro strap to secure the laptop in the bag. The interior is light in color with nice pencil/pen slots & business card slots/notebook slot in the zippered section. This bag had enough space to carry my Lenovo A/C adapter and a few extra items just fine in the larger internal section next to the laptop. The protective padding is light although that's what makes this bag light on a mobile user to carry. There's even a slot inside for an iPod Touch or similar dimension devices to fit just right.

"I finally got round to putting in a slot load DVD burner in this after deciding not to return it for a tray loading Blu-ray player because I had to change my case at the last minute. Looks okay but there are a couple of issues that are outstanding. The two USB drive ports I had purchase a separate part to go from the adapter to a USB 2.0 header because the new case already had two USB 3.0 ports on the front so my motherboard header was in use. The ports were also misaligned at a noticeable angle and while they work the aesthetics on the front of an otherwise really nice looking case (Corsair Obsidian) are marred somewhat. I could see about trying to re-position them however I would have to decide if it is really worth all that effort. The hot-swappable bay is what really makes this a gem. I have a number of portable hard-drives around and as a result a few 2.5in drives. So I popped in a 500GB drive and while I can't see myself doing a lot of swapping, the option to replace a drive fairly easily (without diving into the case) is nice to have.

"I just purchased my 3rd one of these, to round out the display capability of my laptop/docking station.  There's a lot to like about this monitor:1. IPS display.  After having bought a traditional LCD and seeing how the colors skew across the screen, I knew IPS was worth the extra cost.  Frankly, I don't have a real need for it, but it's just nice to have a display with consistency.2. LED backlighting.  The market is flooded with these now, but when I first bought one of these a year ago, it wasn't the case and the premium for them was steep (except with this one).  LED saves energy, which saves both money both from the wall outlet and from the A/C not having to evacuate the heat from the room.  It also supposedly has truer whites, but I must admit I can't see the difference.3. 16:10 resolution.  Frankly, I think 4:3 is even better, but those days are sadly gone for good.  I had a 1600x1200 21"" tube monitor for years and it was great.  Since most of what we do on the computer is vertically oriented, losing 120 vertical lines for a 1920x1080 / 16:9 display (the vast majority of displays these day) really stinks.  By going 16:10, this is 1920:1200, so I didn't lose pixels in either direction.4. Dell speaker accessories.  I guess a monitor with built-in speakers would be OK too, but often the sound quality is pretty weak.  With Dell's AS501 (or newer AS510) speakers, they snap right onto the monitor and get their power from the monitor.  No wall wart to deal with and the speakers go to sleep when the monitor does.  They sounding pretty good to boot.5. The built-in USB hub is nice too I guess.About the only warning I'd give about this monitor, is that it's dot-pitch is a bit low.  The defacto standard is about 100 pixel's per inch and this one is about 90 ppi.  One could both consider this a plus (it's a large display) and a minus if you're putting it next to other monitors.  Originally I had this next to a laptop display which had one on the higher side of the defacto standard (I forget now but I'm thinking about 110 ppi).  Let me tell you, the difference made things cumbersome.  When you dragged windows between screens, they physically change size, the text gets smaller/larger, etc. It was more disconcerting than I expected.It wasn't long before I managed to squeeze another $300 out of the budget to get a second one.  So, if you're planning on setting up multiple monitors, be aware of the pixel densities and try to match them as well as possible.  If you're buying all new ones, make sure they're the same... and 2 of these is as good a choice as you can find in this size/resolution range.So I really like this monitor, and now that my new laptop supports 3 displays... I'm adding another one. :)",2,2,0.00066363,0.0031880832,0.99614835
"Wifi Amplifiers are great to increase the range and link Quality of your network. The only thing is you need 2 of them for it to make any difference. Wifi networks are bidirectional so if the remote computer doesn't have the power to transmit back to the router you won't get a connection. A standard laptop WIFI adapter only transmits at 25 to 50 milliwatts. It wouldn't matter if the router had a 10 watt transmitter, the limiting factor of the weakest link in a network determins it's connection quality. If you install an amplifier on both ends and use YAGI directional antennas you can easily span 200 yards line of sight. In most instances there will be walls, trees and other limiting factors but dual amps will drive the signal through. Another thing to keep in mind regaurding networks is never install anything with 10/100 on a gigabit 1000 network. The lower speed device will drag the entire gigabit network down to 10/100! I found that out the hard way. I had a 10/100 network media player and when connected to my gigabit home network it dragged the whole system down to 10/100 even between computers not inline with the media player so keep that in mind if you ever have speed issues on your network.Thanks,George",2,2,0.0037273546,0.029053608,0.9672191
This unit is one of the best values I have come across for charging all of your usb devices. With 2 2.1 amp plugs you can easily charge you iPad or android devices. Most tablets require a 2 amp plug to charge. My iPad will simply not charge if the plug doesn't meet this requirement as do many other tablets.

"This caddy allows you to mount a 2.5"" drive in the optical bay of your MacBook. You should know that on my MacBook Pro (Unibody 2009), and I'm pretty sure most of the other MacBooks, the optical bay is limited to half link speed (In my case, 1.5gb for the optical bay and 3gb for the hard drive bay). That means that if you are going to use a regular HDD with an SSD, the platter drive (HDD) is the one that should be mounted in the caddy and placed in the optical bay, since it's a slower drive, anyway. The SSD in the hard drive bay will use the full link speed.Putting the HDD in the caddy was pretty straightforward. You'll need to use the SATA connector from the old Superdrive, as well as the little bracket that's held down by two screws, on the end of the Superdrive. The HDD is held in by a plastic piece on one end, and by two screws, which are all supplied.Once you've assembled the HDD in the caddy, I would recommend following the installation video from OWC. Do a Google search for your MacBook model and ""Data Doubler installation"". The only difference will be that you're using this caddy, and not the Data Doubler, but their videos are excellent and easy to follow. It can get a bit tricky to slide the caddy in, but if you do it properly, it will fit snugly and just about the same as the SuperDrive did. If the screw holes don't line up properly, make sure you're not pinching any cables and whatnot. Patience pays off!After you've installed the caddy in the optical bay and an SSD in the hard drive bay, you can configure your own Fusion Drive! Search on YouTube for ""DIY Fusion Drive"" for the best directions!Overall, this caddy isn't as good as theOWC Data Doubler Optical drive to SATA Hard Drive/SSD Converter Bracket Caddy Solution for selected Apple Laptop Models MacBook and MacBook Pro Unibody 13 15 17 SuperDrive(which I've used in the past), but it's much cheaper and actually worked without any modifications (for me).Good luck!",2,2,0.003273692,0.017713487,0.97901285
"I wanted a way to stream audio from my PC, iPod, iPhone and iPad to my stereo system.  This fit the bill perfectly.I simply plugged the RCA jacks into the Aux input to my receiver, power cord into wall outlet and I was good to go.  Then I simply turned on Bluetooth on each of the devices and connected to ""Belkin"" and could immediately begin streaming audio.So far I haven't found any issues with drops or gaps in the music as I listen.  The only issue is that it seems to attenuate the volume level more than I expected.  So I have to turn up the volume on my transmitting device to full and then turn up the volume on the stereo more than I normally would for a direct wired input like CD, cable or DVD.Form factor is small; I easily tucked it out of the way so that it is virtually invisible to anyone not looking for it.

"I had been using the  Thinkpad tablet by Lenovo.  The key feature for me is the stylus - Thinkpad also has one - so that I can take digital handwritten notes for my numerous meetings, tasks, thoughts, ideas, etc.  Thinkpad did all of this for me and I liked Thinkpad quite a bit, but it had a few problems: a) the battery life was terrible, especially since the android upgrade to jelly bean, b) it took way too long to recharge, c) it was a bit on the big side of the tablet market.  The Galaxy Note 10.1 is everything that Thinkpad could do vis-&agrave;-vis stylus handwriting with outstanding battery life, fairly quick recharge, and in a slim, stylish package. I find the Samsung S-Note application to be very good and on par with the Quill application I had been using on my Thinkpad - I could go back to  Quill anytime but I find the S-Note's ability to organize notes using subfolders to be superior to Quill's.  Multi-task screens are an important breakthrough.  I enjoy using Polaris office (pre-packaged on my Note) side-by-side with S-Note, or with the Internet browser.  I wish that the Note could place any application in multi-task mode (side-by-side on one screen), but it only works with some of the built-in applications.  I also wish it was easy to set another application as the default, but even though I prefer Dolphin browser and have set it as default, I always get asked which browser I want to use for certain system tasks...annoying.

"The trick with this antenna is not getting frustrated with moving it around and pointing it in the right direction. I mounted mine on the hand rail of my apartment balcony, second floor and now receive all local channels 4-68. Channel 68 being about 45 miles away. All are received in full green in windows media center, without using a preamp.Previously I had it mounted under and bolted to the 3rd floor balcony to try and keep it out of sight. Reception was iffy on 4 favorite channels.  I then moved it to its' present location with the idea that the antennas footprint is considerably smaller than all the satellite dishes mounted on balconies throughout the complex. The mounting bracket and pole that come with it, are the same type satellite dishes use, Very strong and versatile.

"I read through most of the reviews for this and it seems to me that, for the most part, those with major gripes have not read the instructions or installed the Setpoint software to support the trackpad. It works exactly as advertised. If you are running Windows 8 without (or even with) a touch screen, this will give you the ability to use gestures to enhance the user experience.For reference, I use a MacBook Pro quite a bit and recently migrated to Windows 8 on my desktop. Being a desktop machine, I have no touch screen and even then, using one would just be weird. I noticed when I was away from home for a few weeks using only my MBP, the tendonitis in my elbow went away. I had been doing therapy on it for a while and it had abated to that point but not gone completely. The week I returned home and began using a mouse at work/home, the tendonitis came back which told me that using a mouse is a contributing factor. This is what gave me incentive to try the trackpad, plus I love using the gestures and trackpad in OS X so was excited to try this with Windows. I also have anApple Magic Trackpadthat I use with my Hackintosh (a Mac Pro built from PC parts). Having used the T650 for a few days, I've decided it's a keeper and I'll probably get one for the office even though that computer is running Win 7.The T650 is very responsive but takes a little getting used to. It's plenty big and claims to go a month or so without charging (that remains to be seen on for me since I just got it). Through the Setpoint software, you can control the cursor speed and settings for how gestures and touches behave. The entire pad can click down at the corners as well as modifiers (i.e. right click). Windows 8 gestures seem to work fine once you commit them to memory which doesn't take long. Overall, I'm happy with the performance.The negatives (if you can call them that) and the reason for the 4/5 stars are that the MSRP seems a bit expensive @$79.99 - especially since everyone gripes about Apple's product prices and they offer the Magic Trackpad for $69.99. That said, it can be found for less, including here on Amazon. Also, it may be my learning curve but it can be dicey try to drag windows, icons, or highlight areas of text without the gesture being mistaken for something else, namely zooming (accomplished by pinching in or out). Also, the ""clicking"" down of the pad (as opposed to the tap) gives very little, if any, tactile feedback. It's very hard to feel if you've clicked down or not and part of that reason is that it clicks with a very light touch. The Apple Magic Trackpad does a much better job in this regard and it's a shame it doesn't work well with Windows as it's a better design. Still, for Windows 8 the T650 is probably the best option out there for trackpads!",2,2,0.0011746384,0.006901871,0.9919235

"I had done some research on whether to buy a regular Macro lense or buy these Kenko Extension tubes. I decided to go for the cheaper Kenko and then after using it, perhaps I'd go for the more expensive ones.Well, I've been shooting Macro practically non-stop since I've gotten the Kenko's, and I do think that from the shots I've taken, that the Kenko's really make me look like a better amateur photographer than I really am...As a matter of fact, I do love these Kenko tubes so much, that I can now quite clearly see that there's no need for me to buy the more expensive Macro lenses. Please remember, I'm an amateur, not a professional, but when I look at all the slideshows I've now created with these amazing Kenko tubes, I find it hard to believe that its all my creation!..so, go figure!.I'm enclosing one of my ""youtube"" Macro slideshows for anyone to check out to see for yourself!..So, because of these great Kenko tubes, I've become totally ""addicted"" to shooting macro with them.I do hope the youtube link will open up for you on this site so you can really have a lookat what I'm talking about.[...]",2,2,0.0011843159,0.0034263218,0.99538934

"I picked up 4 of these (red) plus 2 cooler master jet flow's (also red) for my corsair c70. The jet flows are my front intakes and the 4 sickle flows are my top and rear exhaust and side intake. I run all 6 of these fans with an NZXT Sentry II fan controller and I have to say, the combination works very well. Below I will praddle on about why I give these fans a 5 star rating, broken up so you don't have to wade through a giant wall of text.Sound:Increasing the speed of these fans to their maximum settings (even all 4 at once) still only produced a low hum and at low speed idle, I can't really tell they are on at all. All four of these combined don't produce the noise that 1 of the jet flows I installed will make at half speed. Granted, the jet flow is a higher CFM fan but they sound like your case is about to lift off and take flight, probably why they chose that name.Cooling Capability:These fans move plenty of air and so far keep my FX8350 paired with a cooler master hyper 212 evo at 10C when idle and after an hour of gaming the max it reached was 35C. My gigabyte GTX 770 idles at 29C and maxed at 57C. I didn't even have to crank up the rpm's while gaming to keep the temp that low so these fans certainly did impress.Looks:Visually, these fans look great on my black C70 case and produce just the right amount of light so that it will catch someone's eye, but not annoy or distract you when you are gaming or whatever with the lights off. Also, the lights get brighter the higher the fan speed is increased, which I thought was pretty cool. The NZXT Sentry II I mentioned above has leds to label each fan switch that you can change the color of with the push of a button. With it set to red, the colors match these fans perfectly. I took some pics after I got them all installed and sent them to a geeky co-worker of mine and he was jealous because the case looks wicked but not over the top like some cases you see with lights that will blind you and your neighbors.Price:69.69 CFM, 2,000 RPM 120mm LED fans under $10 and I've seen the blue ones as low as $6.99. I looked at some Corsair led 120mm fans and they were $15-$20+ for just 1 and they were only around 50 CFM. Good luck beating this deal.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend these in a heartbeat to anyone. And as always, Amazon got my shipment to me on the day they said it would arrive without so much as a dent in the packaging. All 6 of the fans and the controller arrived and worked perfectly. Kudos Amazon, keep up the good work.",2,2,0.0009760933,0.0030707677,0.9959532

"Fellowes I-Spire Series Tablet Lift (9311301)UPSIDE:-Customize your viewing area of your tablet computer.- Used it often with sturdy bedside table/tray.-Seems to work better with smaller Samsung Galaxy than IPAD. Although IPAD great for watching movies, so it is nice to have a tablet lift.  Great for viewing!-Works really well to turn any table top into your desk/working area. For me, this works great in a hotel room.- Hold your tablet securely. Non-skid pads on the bottom keep this thing from sliding around.- Very simple and non-offensive design. Neutral colors.  Sturdily built. Will not break in the foreseeable future (unless run over by a car-You have to try to break this!- Can put your IPAD on it, set it upon a cabinet or tabletop  watch the Today show, Internet stream, etc. Just perfect.  Or you can stand there and hold up the IPAD for the other person to watch............DRAWBACK:not-adjustable. Should not posse a big problem for most viewers.DOWNSIDE:-Agree with wobble. This changes dramatically from surface to surface. You can mitigate wobble by choosing a surface for your viewing area.  however, no Wobble on a firm surface. Probably will not work so well in a car or wagon. .........IN A NUTSHELL:  Highly Recommended. Well priced, well designed Helpful tool. I think it's great.",2,2,0.00051902665,0.004538305,0.9949426

"Seagate Replica is an external hard drive that comes with a back-up only software/functionality (vs regular external hard drive where you can choose which file you want to back-up). It will back up your entire Windows XP or Vista computer including the operating system, programs, and files. Once you back up your entire PC (and though you can't choose which files to back-up), you can choose whether you want to restore the entire PC or just recover a particular file (this comes handy when you accidentally delete a file or need a previous version of the file). Depending on how much data that you have vs the Replica hard drive size, you might be able to also restore your PC on a several version older. This comes handy if your current or latest backed-up ""image"" has system issues or viruses and you want to restore to the last known good version.The instruction (and steps) to operate Seagate Replica is clear and simple. The first time you back-up your PC will take some time (several hours, though it will vary depending on how much data you have), after that it will be faster as it will only back up changes and incremental files added. You can leave the drive connected at all times to your PC (for more frequent back-up point) or only connect it periodically, i.e. when you want to refresh your back-up image. The recovery CD included will be needed during a full system restore therefore you should keep it handy.There are 2 versions of Seagate Replica. The 250GB and 500GB. The only difference is that the 250GB is made for single PC backup.  So if you want to back up multiple PC or your PC have more than 250GB worth of data, then you will need to get the 500GB.  The 500GB version also comes with the vertical standing dock (which is not critical to have)Pros:1. Perfect solution for backing up your entire Windows XP or Vista PC2. Very easy to use (both back-up and restore process)3. Will allow us to password protect the back-up files (therefore only backing up NTFS file system)4. Will allow us to restore to image that is a several versions older (depending on the size of your data)5. Won't need to delete older version as it will automatically delete oldest version when the free space is getting filled up (easy maintenance)6. Works on Windows XP (or newer) operating systemCons:1. Doesn't work for Macs or older Windows version.2. Provided USB cable is short3. Can't pick and choose files to back-up4. Need recovery CD to restore your entire PC (i.e. when the hard disk fail or operating system crashed)5. Doesn't back up FAT32 file system (most Windows XP PC out there already run on NTFS file system anyway)6. 250GB for single computer or 500GB for multi computer might not be enough space if you have a lot of files (but I'm sure that Seagate eventually will release a bigger capacity version)In conclusion, Seagate Replica is suitable for those who want to back-up their entire Windows XP and Vista PC in a simple and convenient way without caring much about installing/learning a new back-up software, nor caring about the fact that Seagate Replica is not a regular portable hard drive where you can pick and choose which file you want to back-up.Sidarta Tanu",2,2,0.01620942,0.06440837,0.91938215
"Love this adapter set.  The fact that the adapters plug into one another keeps them conveniently all in one place--instead of having three loose pieces.  When you're living out of a suitcase, this particular feature is especially handy.  The slots accept two or three-prong plugs, and unlike some individual adapters I've had in the past, the slots stayed snug.  I plan to buy another set.  I recommend pairing it with the Monster MP OTG400 BK Outlets To Go 4 Outlet Travel Power Strip since I found European hotels are often stingy with outlets.

"I've had this charger for a few months now and there are a lot of good things about it. First, it charges very fast. Second, it does not have an integrated wire so you can replace the USB cable with whatever length you want, or replace it if it gets broken or wears out. That is a huge plus over the original Kindle charger. It's also very small and so far hasn't interferred with other things plugged in to the wall socket.The only bad thing is the price.

"My Nikkor and Minolta/Super Cosina lenses are happy again. A couple of cheap adapters and you can use your old high quality lenses again. This camera is amazing and I have run the gamut or tests. The 16mm and Ultra Wide Converter are really good additions if you want to add to the kit lens for not a lot of money. The kit lens is actually very good and produces nice clear images with very little distortion. Be prepared to read up on advice and study the handbook for this camera. It is loaded with options. can get very complex if you want and has excellent reviews. The Intelligent Auto mode produces very good pictures for beginners or professionals. I have been a photographer for 40 years and obtained my first digital camera only 4 years ago because I wasn't happy with picture quality till then. This technology has finally come of age at an affordable price. Others will disagree but you can get very similar results from this camera as those from a $6-8K DSLR. Read the reviews from many independent professionals who agree. It is so nice to have a high quality camera that is not a huge, pretentious and heavy beast. You will take more pictures with this because it is so light and ready to go with you in a small camera bag.Some complain about the lack of lenses available but the new Sony, Sigma and Zeiss e-mount lenses fill the gap plus all your old lenses that require simple $10-30 adapters although you will be using manual mode. The focusing assist using peaking level is really good for using your old lenses. Buy one of the generic remote commanders for $10 for additional functionality and low light level tripod use. Try the speed priority continuous shooting mode and it will blow you away how fast this can shoot. I'm not sure of the exact time after turning on the camera to photo ready but it is only about a second or two. The build quality is excellent and weight is light enough but not a cheap feeling.

"Pros: Small, lightweight, affordable, stylishCons: N/aBottom-Line: I am very pleased with the M510 Cordless Laser MouseI have used a plethora of ""mice"" over the intervening years but the cordless laser is by far my favorite and Logitech is always my manufacture of choice.  I have tried others, but I have always come back to Logitech; the company makes the best cordless mouse for my money.  So, when it came time to replace my stock (Dell) corded mouse at work, my only decision was which Logitech model I would choose.  I'll take a M510 Cordless Laser Mouse, thank you.The 411The Logitech M510 Cordless Laser Mouse is an entry-level input device that serves up the basics in mouse technology.  The M510 Cordless Laser Mouse is a right-handed mouse that utilizes Logitech's patented laser technology and works with the company's Unifying transceiver technology.  The Unified transceiver can control up to (6) wireless devices.The M510 Cordless Laser Mouse is designed with a Universal scroll wheel as well as a forward and backward buttons, controls that have become almost indispensable to me.  The M510 Cordless Laser Mouse will work with Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7.  The mouse can also be used with Mac OS 10.4 or later.Power for the M510 Cordless Laser Mouse is provided by (2) AA batteries that are supposed to last up to two years.  And to maximize battery life, a convenient On/Off switch (bottom of the unit) and smart sleep mode are provided.  A battery indicator LED on the top of the unit reminds you when it time to change the batteries.First ImpressionsAs it turns out my choice of the M510 Cordless Laser Mouse was right on the money; the mouse is a lightweight, no-frills right-handed mouse the fits well in the palm of the hand.  The mouse uses a laser with a setting of 1200 dpi in order to deliver precision screen tracking and cursor control; it was one of the main reasons I chose this mouse.Two other reason(s) I chose the M510 Cordless Laser Mouse: small (USB) transceiver and long battery life; both features make this mouse ideal for laptop users, but desktop user like me can also make it our own.Another useful feature is the forward and backward buttons on the left hand side of the mouse that make thumb toggling a breeze.  And I like the universal scroll; it is ever useful when browsing long web pages.Installation of the M510 Cordless Laser Mouse is a breeze.  The Logitech desktop software, SetPoint, does not ship with the unit, but the mouse will work without it.  However, SetPoint does allow you to program the buttons and settings.  Note: SetPoint does not work well with Windows 7; some of those units functionality is impaired; i.e. doesn't work!ConclusionI am very pleased with the M510 Cordless Laser Mouse.

"Update:  Still love the unit, but I have discovered there is about a 10 second delay from when I shift into reverse until the camera turns on and the image comes up.  Under normal routine conditions, by the time the image displays on the screen I am done reversing.  It works it you shift into reverse, wait 10 seconds. and then start moving. Still give the product a mythical 6 rating.1 month update:Still very happy with the unit.  Now have installed a back up camera.  Very very cool to see the unit come to life, flip up the screen, and display the scene behind the car when shifting into reverse.  It was a bit of work to install the camera and run the cables to the head unit.  It took a couple of hours, but well worth the effort.Only 1 minor problem.  I have upgraded from Droid to IPhone 5 since I installed the unit..  The Bluetooth connection isn't quite as smooth as it was with the Droid.  The Acoustik tries unsuccessfully to download the IPhone phone book.  It take the unit about a minute to go through its routine before it gives up.  There might be a slight compatibility issue between the Acoustik and IPhone 5 (which is also very very cool). However, the Acoustik also works very well as the hand free speaker/microphone.  Much better than the dedicated Jabra hands-free that  I was using.  So after a month I am upping the rating to a 6.  Still an incredible value (I bought for $166).The one feature that the Acoutik does not have is the radio information scroll some other radio have that provides the station name and often the name of the song.  Too bad because it would seem such a simple feature to add.  But still,  the unit looks and sounds great none the less.  This unit has far exceeded my expectations.original review:I was persuaded to try this unit by all of the great reviews, but was I highly skeptical.  And then the box came in with graphics that I swear only a 16-year old kid could dream up (smoking skulls with wings!!??)  and a  broken-English instruction/installation manual that added to my reservations about the product.  I almost decided to return it be fore putting it in.  I am glad I didn't.VERY NICE UNIT with GREAT sound (and I am very picky about sound systems). I am not sure how it is possible, but  the sound from the radio is soooo much better than the premium Infinity system I replaced.  Very intuitive controls, both manual and on-screen.  Bluetooth paired up right away and continues to sync up every time I get in the car with my Droid.  I haven't installed the back up camera yet because the installation manual was wrong, I later found a separate installation sheet tucked in with the warranty info.I installed the unit myself in about 3 hours.  I strongly suggest that you purchase a wiring adapter that will plug right into the existing wiring connector from Crutchfield ([...]) when you order the PTID unit.  Note:  I suggest using the 'chat' with the staff' option on the Crutchfield website to track down the correct adapter  They were great.  This adapter will allow you to keep the original wiring, which keeps things much cleaner, and make it much easier to wire.  I wired the adapter to the head unit in my kitchen and then carried the whole ready-to-plug-in unit down to the garage and just plugged it in.  Much, much easier than trying to connect the wires when in the  dash board.Like all flip-up screen units, the head unit does stick out about an inch from the dash board to accommodate the flip-up screen.  It does look a little weird sticking out like that, but it doesn't look bad.  In fact when on it looks pretty good.I have seen similar units for anywhere from  $300  to  $600.  So for $166 this product is an absolute bargain.With the self-installation ($200) I figure I just got an $800 unit for les than $200.  It was a good day.",2,2,0.0045546275,0.027222816,0.9682226
"I love the BBC channel and was looking for a DVD player to watch my shows on. This looked like a good one, and the video player is quite easy to use.Setting it up via daisy chain to my existing player was a bit of a challenge, because the manual was in Spanish/French not English, but google helped me figure it out.I would personally prefer a larger remote.

"This was free with a camera kit I purchased. Otherwise I'd pass.It's awesome for what it is.Very sufficient padding, long enough to fit a decent camera body and zoom lens. I have a T3i and my largest lens is the canon 55-250mm. That fit without issue. I don't own a longer lens to further test.The hard bottom allows you to site the bag upright and will also help in protecting your equipment should it fall.Quality has been great. It's well built, comfortable and has a pocked to store your memory cards and such.So why wouldn't I pay for it?Maybe I haven't been into photography long enough, but if I'm going to carry a bag that would only fit one camera. I'd rather just carry the camera itself with it's strap.I ended up purchasing ASIN: B001T9N120 for under $8 which allows me to fit my T3i with 18-55mm attached and also store my 55-250mm and 50mm lenses.Everyone has different needs.

"Hi,This is the fourth case I've purchased for my iPad.  Yes, I think we can all agree I need to enter some sort of twelve-step program.  ""Hello, my name is John and it's been zero weeks since I bought an iPad case.""Moving right along here is why my quest is over.  The other cases I've tried are:- The Apple case (Edges are sharp making it uncomfortable to carry. I also honestly think it feels cheap.  It's like cardboard covered with thin vinyl for forty or fifty bucks.)- The OtterBox Defender (A rockin' case but too bulky for my current needs)- The Clear Wave Premium Crystal Candy skin also from Amazon (was a winner until I got my ZAGG invisibleSHIELD installed.  They don't play well together.)This is the one for me because:- The level of protection vs. bulk is just right.  The OtterBox was excellent but more than doubled the width of the iPad.- It looks good aside from the little nubbies on the corners.  They don't really look bad, just a little odd.- The snap on/off screen cover works well and can be left at home when you don't need it.  When needed it installs easily.- As I mentioned it works great with the ZAGG InvisibleSHIELD.  This can be a problem because the edges on some cases butt up against the shield on the screen.  This invariably results in the shield edges lifting and being ruined.  With this case it overlaps the shield enough that they don't interfere with each other.- The price is reasonable compared with other nice casesHere are some reasons it might not be the one for you:- Corner nubbies might be a turnoff- Not as glamorous looking as some other options- There is no built in stand like the Apple and OtterBox casesLast but not least it fits in my Padholder automotive bracket.  That thing is really cool.  You can check my other reviews if you want to learn more about it.Best regards,John",2,2,0.122407235,0.12611386,0.7514789

"Many consumers complain that this item DOES NOT WORK and I have to DISAGREE. This item DOES WORK and here is what you have to do:1) Get a new mini USB cable and plug it into the product.2) The proprietary program will load instantly and you can start uploading programs ASAP. The program allows you to sequence the photo order you want and crop the images. The reason windows did not recognize the device is because of a bad USB cable from the manufacturer which did not make a the connection to the computer so windows doesn't know it's connected in the first place. If you have another USB cable, use it and it will work and windows will detect it instantly!3) Make a new folder for the photos you want on to be displayed. Name it 'Keychain_Photos"" Copy and paste the images you want into this folder. Move the folder to ""my computer"" but do not put the folder you have created in another folder. (The reason is that the program is not advanced enough to open many levels of folders - a folder within a folder - because there are other non-image files that might confuse the program and make it not want to open it because it's fooled into believing the whole folder doesn't have photos.)Just follow these in good faith and see that it will work. No good things ever came to skeptics.4) If step 1 and 2 have already been done and the computer recognizes the device a screen will pop up and you should follow the instructions from there. If not go to my computer and the device will register under  ""photoviewer"" click it and the program will load.5) When the program loads, click on my computer and find the folder you have just saved. If the photos are in compatible formats you will see them instantly. Click on them and then crop to your liking. When you are done, press upload.6) Click exit and select OK. Wait 2 seconds before disconnecting.7) Turn it on and enjoy!---------------------------------------------I gave a four star because item does work and is as advertised. Not perfect.

"The HT-S6300 is replacing a mid-range 8 year old RCA 5.1 surround sound system, still going strong just wanted to update to a DTS 7.1 unit.  Shipped UPS and was very well packaged and protected in the box.  I received this system last week and spent a good part of Saturday afternoon setting it up. It went into a tight workable area of my entertainment area so maneuvering around for me was somewhat awkward.  The speakers have the screw ready notches in the back, can be hung vertically or horizontal, I liked that option.  I couldn't find too many reviews on this model as it seems like it may be a new model for the coming season but I feel like I got a decent price for everything it has to offer.  The sub-woofer is BIG.  My sofa end table is not much larger in size so the case really sticks out like a sore thumb by the side wall, although it is attractive with a combination of black wood tone with the front the black shiny piano finish (dust magnet).  I have a Panasonic blue-ray DVD player, LG 42"" 1080p LED flat screen TV,  Bright House cable box and WDTV Live Plus Media Player hooked up to it all via HDMI cables.  I played part of a movie (Finding Nemo whale scene) and it sounded very good especially the bass, I had to turn it down some by the volume control located at the back of the sub-woofer. Convenient.  I was so happy with my purchase.  So that evening I settled in to watch a couple of action movies to get the real sound effect of my new set-up.  Disappointment set in.  It stared cutting off or making a high pitch squealing sound then would lose connection with the TV.  Granted only a minute or two is lost before reconnect but when this happens a few times per 2 hour movie it can be very aggravating and frustrating.  Went online and read in some forums that the receiver has an overheating issue.  I touched the top of the receiver and it was HOT!.  I had the acceptable 6+"" from the top shelf and the shelf that this unit sat on but I increased it to 8+"" , an AC vent also blows right down on the center so it has good air flow/ventilation.  Didn't make any difference.  This sucks as I can't enjoy watching a movie without the cut offs every so often (haven't watched much TV so don't know if it does it with that or not).  I can turn everything on and within 10 minutes of a movie running it will disconnect so I am not real sure if it is an over heating issue.  The receiver is no where near as hot as it is after a couple of hours of playing.  I will call Onkyo customer service this weekend and hear what they have to say.  I've already tossed out the box so I can't even return this system for something different. Then to have to pull the entertainment center out and unhook everything........not a happy camper right now considering the price I paid for a supposedly quality product.  Especially upsetting to think that Onkyo is aware of a possible heat problem and still continues to sell these units with said issues.Will update later if/when this issue gets resolved.UPDATE 9/19/10:  I actually had a couple of problems causing my lost connection and/or shut offs noted above.  Purchasing a small fan and placing it in the cabinet over the receiver helped.  But when that didn't solve the problem completely I discovered it was the cables.  I had bought the super cheap, CHEAP HDMI cables from Amazon because I had to get so many for hooking up my new set up. Believe it or not, when the sub-woofer would kick in from an action scene or the music would amp up, the vibration from the bass would cause my cable to lose connection.  Getting better quality cables made such a big difference!  I absolutely love my new Onkyo system and set up.  It certainly deserves 5 stars now.",2,2,0.0037422813,0.026684688,0.969573

"The first thing to say is that the product works great.But i don't give it 5 starts because of some issues I've had with it.The first one is that I accidentally drop it form my night stand. It about 23 inches from the floor. After that it didn't worked so i freaked out. I waited for like half an hour and plugged again and it worked. The only problem is that now every time i picked it up and move it slightly to the sides i feel like the hard drive is gonna fall form the case. It moves in a weird way. Of course it happens only when it's working and i guess it's because the hard drive it's spinning but is not completely straight. And i can't fix it because I don't see any screws to take out so i guess the case it's all glued.Another issue is that after leaving it plugged for several hours (sometimes days) it stopped working. I have to unplugged it for 30 seconds to make it work again. And the temperature sensor doesn't show that is hot. Since it doesn't happens very often it doesn't bothers me that much. But I'm sure it's not because of the fall since I have another WD product (1TB Passport) and it happens the same with it.But the in the end it works as I need it.

"We wouldn't consider driving our cars without a spare tire in anticipation of a flat, and likewise every now and then there is an occasion when our trusty cell phones will need a booster charge when we're on the road. At every airport I see frantic passengers scrambling to get to an outlet to charge their phones, and I snicker because I had my trusty Anker Astro3E Power nearby. However, that unit is quite large and is not suitable for fitting in my pocket, so there are many opportunities where a compact unit is preferable. The Anker Astro Mini certainly fits the bill.The unit is about the size and weight of a single AA battery flashlight. It fits comfortably in my pocket and appears to be very well constructed. It comes with a compact Micro USB cable and black mesh cloth case which I probably won't use. I received it late yesterday and promptly charged it  which took several hours, so I assume that it was discharged when I got it. It has an amber indicator light which shows that it is charging and correspondingly turns green when it is in use. Next to that is a small on/off button. I used the Mini this morning to charge my Samsung S3 phone and it promptly went from a 69% charge to 100% and then turned off.I understand that the Mini has something called &#34;PowerIQ technology which provides enhanced compatibility with Android and iPhones and charges them more efficiently. As I am not an engineer I cannot comment on that and can only to take their word for it. What I do know is that the Mini will certainly be a frequent companion of mine especially when I use the battery draining GPS function of my cell phone.",2,2,0.0026375214,0.011855187,0.98550737
"High speed class 10 memory works great in my new Microsoft Surface RT (saved my over $80 for an addition 32GB from MS). All of my work for the past decade fits into 32GBs. At $19, it costs less than any other class 10 card (in other words, it's the fastest at this price). It's plenty fast for me. But, as reviewer NLee points out, it is very easy to confuse this with much slower class 6 cards (so be careful as you compare). This card worked as soon as I plugged it in - with no problems. Highly recommended. Now, some test the Transend microSD as faster (see first commend for one URL), but performance is more likely limited by your reader. SanDisk is the most popular for good reasons (#1 selling microSDHC card at Amazon). Now, this also means it is the most popular to counterfeit (the likely source of most poor experiences - recent sources estimate that millions have been purchased just on eBay and others have confirmed getting fakes through Amazon vendors).

"I just received the Fuji HS50EXR and did some test shots and compared these and other features to my current camera the Panasonic FZ150The camera was shipped quickly and came in a box that was well packaged in a larger box.  I had no trouble charging the battery (took about two hours), inserting and powering the camera.  I had looked at the manual for the HS50EXR online and had gained some familiarity with its buttons/controls and features.  I did not find it difficult to use many of the features after set up was completed.The camera is heavier by about 200 g than a Lumix FZ150 but the increase in weight is not bad and I find no real problem carrying it with the strap provided.  I decided to buy a new camera after returning from a trip to Oregon and using the FZ150 (bought when camera first was available).  The telephoto lens is moved electronically and it is slow to move and I was not alway able to get it adjusted to the correct magnification I wanted.  I had mixed results with IQ..often quite good and then other times the resolution was poor and I normally use the IA setting.  Also colors in some shots did not seem correct.  Most frustrating is shutter lag.  I have missed good shots because of this issue.  I have never owned a Fuji camera but I decided to buy this model because it had a quick AF, short shutter lag, reviews indicate good IQ and a good telephoto lensI did test shots of animals, close and long telephoto, water moving, landscapes with shade and sun, etc.  I compared to what I have been achieving with the FZ150.  I find the colors with the Fuji camera are more accurate and resolution is better.  Shutter lag is almost non existent and AF quickly focuses.  It does have some problems with long telephoto but I can quickly adjust using manual focus which I could not do easily with FZ150.  My preliminary tests are not large in number but so far I am very pleased.A well built camera:  Disaster struck on the second day.  I had it on the rear seat of our car and when I first pulled out my sweater the camera went with it and fell on the asphalt and bounced!  My heart beat dropped as I picked it up and wondered if I had broken it...no insurance.  I powered it up and all is OK.  This impresses me after the camera bounced on the hard  asphalt.I am giving it a four star because I have done only limited tests.I am not a professional photographer...only someone who takes pictures of family and travels.",2,2,0.001864815,0.0051120496,0.99302316
"Let me start by saying that I have used Home Theater Master remotes for years.  First, a MX-500 and then a MX-800 (with the optional RF).  If you are not familiar with Home Theatre Master remotes, these are often considered ""pro"" remotes.  In fact, most of the more advanced models now must be programmed by a professional installer. I tried the Logitech Harmony, reluctantly, assuming it could not get close to the Home Theater Master remotes.  I was very wrong!  I think the Harmony is far more useful and much, much more easy to program. As I continue to ""tweak"" it, there have not been any issues.  All commands have been able to be either programmed or learned.  I have a pretty sophisticated system and this remote does it all. I like the feel and layout of the buttons and the touch screen works very well. This is the best univeral remote I have ever had and I've had quite a few.

"Great OEM apple charger, identical to the one my i7 Mac Book Pro came with a year ago.  It came with the long and short ac cable, all of the protective packaging was there, the only thing is it was in a brown box and not a fancy apple one.  I saw many poor reviews for this one and others which led me to believe that bad knock offs were being sold as OEM, that is simply untrue.  Yes the apple chargers get warm when operating, they are a transformer!  If your computer is dead and you want to charge it up fast it will take some power which will also make some heat.  Something to consider for you core 2 duo users, the original mag safe chargers were 65w lets call it a VW Bug, and the new i7 computers take much more power so they got the 85w (a Audi A6), If you want to go 120mph like an i7 chip does the vw will over heat and burn up where the a6 will get hot but run well.  But if you have an older Core2Duo machine which like 45mph, the vw will get hot but work well, and the A6 will run nice and cool because you are not maxing it out.  Basically if you are having heat issues you will need a higher spec charger with 85W being the top from apple for now.If you are looking for a replacement charger, this one will work perfect, it is an apple original unit so it will work the exact same as your original charger did, if you are having some other problems with cords breaking, or it is to hot for you then yes you will have to search for another brand charger like Belkin, or consider that your standards are not realistic.",2,2,0.0014674298,0.0025352023,0.9959974

"I have really hated Bose and their marketing up until this product. In the past I've disliked their cheap build quality (plastic enclosures with paper cone drivers) in the Acoustimas systems and always felt their marketing department was ridiculous. I liked to use the quote &#34;Better sound through Marketing&#34;.This has all changed with this SoundLink Mini. Honestly I thought the display at my local Target was rigged when I was playing music from my phone through it via BlueTooth. I actually picked it up off the display and extended it to the full length of the security cable and was moving it around to see if the sound was coming from inside the display (like a subwoofer hidden inside). I quickly realized this tiny aluminum enclosure was actually pumping out this bass. This is amazing bass for something this small. It sounds more like a very good quality computer 2.1 system with a separate subwoofer. Does this sound like a full size stereo? No. Does it sound like a small aluminum box? No.It sounds far larger than it is and on some tracks almost sounds like you have a real subwoofer in the room (think a small 8&#34; sub often used in a small stereo system). Considering it can produced this sound out of a portable speaker you could put in a coat pocket is RIDICULOUS. I've played this thing for non-hifi people like my wife and my mother and they were impressed. I also played it for former hifi people like friends and my father. They were equally impressed. Whatever engineering Bose did with this little thing payed off. It plays great clear audio with very substantial bass. You can even play it very loud filling a large room and the speaker seems to keep up without distorting  and falling apart. One note of caution, overly bassy house type music can cause the speaker to sort of &#34;honk&#34; at moderate to loud volumes. I assume the speaker is simply trying to produce the exaggerated bass and simply is going beyond its abilities.For pop, jazz, blues, rock, and vocals this thing is fabulous. The battery life seems to be very reasonable (outlasts my MacBook Air) and the pedestal/charger is great. The build quality is Apple like (i.e. awesome).

"I read many reviews before purchasing this Otterbox for my new Ipad 4 Retina Display.  I also shopped around and read reviews for other protective cases (I have a 4 year old in the house) and narrowed it down to this one and the Griffin military grade.  I was reading that the Griffin had some issues with the port covers, and really wanted to find something that I would not have to be using a box cutter on to get it right.  I have had the Otterbox for about a week now, and feel comfortable choosing it as my candidate for the best case around.  Here are the pros and cons that I have found:Pros:Looks and fits really nice to my Ipad.Seems to be fully protected.  Some drops of water spilled on it yesterday and I was so glad the case was on.Great open port for the speaker so it doesn't hamper the sound.Sound is pretty nice.  The sound effects from games are super nice.  Instruments sound like actual instruments, etc.Ports are nice, charging port is easy to access.Touch sensor is still really accurate.The stand is a nice touch.  I have used it a few times.  Seems to be good.Cons:Sort of kills the Retina Display- anyone who says it doesn't, you are full of it.  I am going to take out the clear plastic cover I think.No base in the speakers, but I guess that is expected.The button on the front of the Ipad (towards bottom, to get it going) is really hard to push in now.So based on all of this, I believe there are some things you just can't get around, like the reduced Retina picture quality.  Overall, I feel so much better with everyone in the house handling it daily.  A must-have for your Ipad.",2,2,0.020182112,0.1494245,0.83039343

"Used this to replace a very old PIR unit that was part of a system I bought from Radio Shack a very long time ago.  This unit was not as convenient to install since it requires you to...1. remove the circuit board from the base of the unit.2. use a sharp tool to punch out holes in the base of the unit for the mounting screws3. after attaching to the wall, reinstall the circuit board making sure it is aligned correctly for the desired angle of view; not so easy while it is mounted on the wall.The other minor complaint is that the LED is visible not only through the small window provided, but it also lights up the white IR screen.  This just makes the unit look much less professional.On the plus side it works as it should and so far (knock on wood) it has not yet falsed like the unit it replaced.---- update -----It's been a month and a half now since I installed this unit, and another one of the old Radio Shack sensors has started falsing.

The Grantwood Anti-Glare Screen Protector is basically what I wanted - a screen protector. This one appears to be well made and should stand up to any but a sharpened edge. The fit is fine and the slight space I have seen others point to is necessary to allow one to apply this aftermarket accessory. I emphasize accessory as it is my opinion the Kindle should have a protective layer on the screen as a standard component. As far as glare is concerned it reflects light as did the naked screen. I never did an A/B comparison but there is still some glare. I am glad there were two in the package as the first one didn't go on as easily as the instructions or video would have you believe. The thin film on the top of the protector wouldn't release and pulled the protector completely off the screen. The removed protector is no longer any good so you have to use the other. I could put them on with no problems now after that learning curve. I recommend a screen protector (as well as a cover) to any that purchase a Kindle as they can be damaged easier than one thinks. If you get these be prepared to use both. I think the shipping price to be a bit high - $3.99 - when the protectors were only $4.99. They could slip it into an envelope for 41 cents.,2,2,0.0009997332,0.01635391,0.98264647
"This projector has been a great fit in a fairly bright living room. The projector is approx. 12.5 feet from the wall, which creates a 115 inch screen. The wall was already painted a light brown, which I planned on painting white or adding a screen. After setting up the projector and seeing the great color and general excellence of the picture we decided just to leave the wall the way it is.In the daylight with the blinds open the dark scenes are a little too dark, but closing the blinds is not a lot to ask for a 115 inch screen. Overall the picture is much better and brighter than I had hoped. If you are considering this projector and have a large wall to point it at, go ahead and buy it.We got this projector from Amazon for $635 and now whenever I see TVs in a store I am wondering why people pay 2 to 3 times as much for a TV that is a quarter of the size!UPDATE 5/16/2011Still working great, no complaints.

"If you want a snug fitting, well made case for your iPad mini with the auto ""sleep/wake"" function this is the case for you! I REALLY wanted a case that kept the full screen visible and this case does the job. I like how the designers actually created it for real life use! The grooves that hold the screen in place when it's open are deep so that it won't constantly fall like some cases. The padding inside protects the screen when it's closed.I only have two suggestions for future versions.Two suggestions, not really downsides....- Give us a 360 degree rotation- Give us a clasp to hold it together when you fold it back. That said, the strap provided to hold it when you have it folded back does a great job, it would be nice if it locked together to hold it in place if you don't want to use the strap.All in all, I am extremely pleased with this case.

It is entirely USB powered, so no power cord or brick. The drive was used once so far to transfer some old MIDI files off a floppy from 1997 (!). Files transferred in a very reasonable time. The only possible caveats to this drive seem to be a short, attached USB cord (you may need an extender cable - the attached cord is perhaps two feet) and there was an odd pause during the middle of the file transfer. No intervention was necessary but the pause was long enough (perhaps 20 seconds) to make me look twice at the drive and consider reconnecting.

It is only 12&#34; long (1 foot)- None of the ports are &#34;always on&#34;, which might have been handy for some usersNot really a con, but people should know: this hub is NOT powered, meaning that it can only provide the &#34;usual&#34; amount of power specified by USB standards. I do not believe it can power more than one high-drain USB device, just like a normal USB port on a computer. Do not expect to charge more than one smartphone or tablet at a time.This product is very well designed and of higher quality. I am thoroughly satisfied by the build quality, the ease of getting it working, and the compatibility of the hub.Quick explanation of my planned usage of this device: I am using this 4 port hub to leave a USB powered external hard drive always connected to my Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 leaves some power available to the USB ports while it is shut down. This causes problem with my external hard drive because it is powered only by USB. It will attempt to spin up and become &#34;ready&#34;, not get the required power, spin-down and try again forever. The cable that fits the hard drive is very short and does not seem like it will survive constant plugging/unplugging. This hub allows it to remain plugged in and a quick toggle of the switch provides full power or no power.I fully recommend this product to anyone who needs a USB port (or four) that can be toggled on and off without being unplugged.",2,2,0.022247758,0.23778203,0.7399702

The company was very good about the refund and I appreciated it!  I was so happy with the services that I reordered with them!,2,2,0.00039166323,0.0011665771,0.99844176
"I purchased this transmitter to use with an HDTV to be able to listen to the TV while using the treadmill.  I love how simple it is to pair.

"There are very few options for the Kindle Fire HDX as far as covers go. I was pretty amazed when I first opened the box up. There is nothing that attaches to the kindle, the entire case is magnetic. It holds the kindle fire to the back, it is strong enough you don't have to worry about it slipping out. It's great too because it wakes and sleeps when covering and uncovering the kindle with the flap. I love the origami back, it makes for propping very easy on almost any surface (including your lap). I do really love everything about this case except for the price which is the reason for the 4 stars. With there being so little options out there it's extremely unfair (in my opinion) for them to charge so much for this case.

"Like many others, I like to spend time outdoors with my equipment. I wanted a pack that would carry my photography gear as well as necessities like a first aid kit, jacket, a little food, etc. This worked nicely in meeting those needs, and it's made from recycled material.I would generally only take one camera body, three lenses (one on the camera), some filters, extra cards, battery pack, and a tripod. All fit fine in the lower compartment. OK, not the tripod, that hung on the outside. There is also plenty of room up top for non-photo gear. The straps fit well, and are easily adjusted. The sternum belt and waist belt are definite requirements when carrying a pack with any weight. The waist belt can be tucked away when not in use.Overall this is a very comfortable pack. There are many little things that is has that you may not notice, unless you've had a pack without them. For example, there are little loops around the straps that you can slide up or down so that the ends of a strap are not flapping in the breeze. I have had other packs without this feature and after several hours of hiking, those strap ends can chafe the skin raw. Also, the shoulder straps can be adjusted for fit, but there is a second set of straps high on the shoulder straps that you can use to adjust how high the pack rides on your back.The one negative comment I have about this pack is that while it is comfortable against your back, it does not breathe at all. My back was covered with sweat after just a few minutes with the pack on, while I was walking through the airport.  I am used to true day-packs that have a frame with mesh between your back and the pack so that you get air movement. Ultimately I may end up getting a day-pack and some cushioned photo boxes to put inside unless the hiking pack makers and the photo pack makers get together.",2,2,0.0017510367,0.028355202,0.96989375

I was Skyping with a friend in Japan, and we got to talking about video cameras, So I checked Amazon -- saw a Vivitar (love & trust their lenses) and they had seven cameras left at under $30.  For that price -- grabbed one.Turns out the three AAA batteries required weigh more than the camera, and the camera is smaller than my Sony.You have zoom, view screen and all the goodies necessary to get that video -- without having to carry anything heavy or cumbersome.  Liked it so much I was telling a friend about it, and, as there were more available, he immediately grabbed one to take to a Rebba concert he's going to in late April 2013.Because it is so small, the setup buttons are a pain ... but the light weight and everything else about it, combined with a cost that is less than eating out at the neighborhood restaurant ... this is something worth considering.

"Unlike other reviewers, I will not waste your time telling you stories about how many pictures/songs/movies fit in my hard drive. Based on my 1 year Experience with this drive bay, Here are the facts.In the Package:1 SATA cable, 2 Keys, 4 Screws. Activity Light Sata/Molex Cable, & The Drive Bay.The Good:-Does not require the use of Caddies.-Hot Swappable.-No Drivers needed.-Supports SATA II-Jumpers for SATA I support on older motherboards.-Front Power/Activity Lights.-Rubber Grommets reduce hard drive vibrations-Lock to keep your friends from stealing your porn filled hard drive.The Bad:-No Cooling Fan-Requires that you screw it into case, making it incompatible with most tool-less cases.-Door has that Cheap ""this is going to break soon"" feel.-Cheaply made lock may not stop your clever friends from stealing your porn filled hard drive.Compatibility Issue with VelociRaptor Hard Drives (It's Biggest Flaw):Not Compatible with WD VelociRaptor Hard Drives. VelociRaptor Hard drives are mini hard drives set inside a hollowed out 3.5-in heat sink. There is a gap between the drive & the front of there cooling fins. The Kingwin has a hard drive support wire on the top that keeps hard drives from angling down & falling to there death if you should happen to let go of your hard drive with it sticking out halfway during insertion & removal. This wire gets caught in the VelociRaptor Gap, forcing you to insert a plastic card to keep the guide wire from catching on the VelociRaptor drives gap.Try at your own risk:The support wire can be removed by unscrewing it off with a phillips screwdriver, but that means you must keep a tight grip on your hard drive when inserting or removing it to prevent your Drive & the Floor from getting to know each other better.Note:No mention about max hard drive size support on box or manual, Have tested this with a 2TB drive & it works fine. Do not know if it can handle anything larger than 2TB.Summary:I own 3 of these things & not of of them has nuked, burned, exploded, raped, molested, or tortured any of the hard drives in them in there 1 yr of operation.Would buy again for the price if the build did not use a tool-less case.",2,2,0.012235865,0.13604322,0.8517209

"I bought the PIONEER AVICX850BT after having previously used theKenwood DNX570HD Touchscreen In-Dash 2-DIN Multimedia DVD Receiver with Navigation/Bluetooth/HD Radiofor three miserable months. The Pioneer beats the Kenwood in just about every way and it's less expensive, too. The GPS, despite not being Garmin, works well and it has a couple nifty features Kenwood's Garmin navigation doesn't have (like the nifty split screen that shows you which exit to take and a line that constantly shows where your destination is relative to the direction you're traveling). Streaming music over the Bluetooth sounds great as does making calls through the stereo system. And the Bluetooth connects with your phone immediately upon starting your car. The screen isn't too bright for night driving, either. In all of these ways it is superior to the Kenwood and, unlike its buggy competitor, the Pioneer just works.",2,2,0.0017087149,0.002352097,0.99593925
"Back in August I was sold on Folding@Home project and started donating CPU time and electricity.  My machine was running 24x7 and everything went smooth. I escalated position in the donor scale very quickly thanks to the processing capabilities of an NVIDIA 9800GX2 and a quad core CPU.  A month passed by and I was surprised by the increase in my power bill.  I still wanted to contribute, but I did not like the idea of spending a little fortune in utility services.  I stopped folding in my Gaming machine and started looking for a solution.My second PC has a nice 2.6GHz dual core CPU, 1GB of RAM, 40GB hard disk, on-board video and 500W power supply.  This machine is my Internet/download station and it would became perfect for folding at home PC after upgrading it with a new GPU.To succeed I need a GPU (NVIDIA/ATI) that would give the most Folging@Home points for the power.  After a little research I discovered that the cheapest and really powerful to use was a NVIDIA 8800GT.  It has the G92 core, it uses only one 6 pin PCIe power and in Amazon this XLR8 had the best price around.  ATI solutions are great video cards, but are not optimized for F@H number crunching.Right now I'm running a couple of F@H clients, an NVIDIA GPU and a single tread CPU one.

The one thing that really set these apart was the fit.  the klipsch s4 headphones have a more rigid ear piece (lack of a better term) which for me was a constant pain...they would loosen and slip which of course affected the sound quality.  the isport ear pieces are great.  once you find the set the fits and get them in...they stay in.  and the sound isolation is much better too.  definitely recommend this set for everyday use.",2,2,0.1290758,0.29673418,0.57419

"When it comes to surge protectors, our home's appliances have been under their protection for several decades now. In the 1990's, we began having power outages more frequently and began losing refrigerators, telephones, microwaves and having damage to our televisions. Ohio is a tree state and every time a tree falls during a bad storm, a power grid is knocked out. When the power gets knocked out, the whole house feels as if it's shaking, but when the power comes back on, it feels as if the house is being knocked off it's foundation. I don't know which is worse on the appliances, the power being suddenly shut off or suddenly coming back on, but I do know that investing in surge protectors for all your appliances is actually more important than the appliances you choose.This Panamax 10 plug M10-HT-PRO Home Theater Management is actually the best surge protector and noise filter our family has ever owned. We bought an 8 plug Monster Power Home Theater Power Center Surge Protector with Clean Power Filtering for $150.00 years ago when we bought our first Samsung LCD Flat Screen tv. We weren't taking any chances on having any electrical damage happen to a tv that costs over $1,000.00, not to mention the blu-ray player, dvd player, all region player and dvd recorder that are hooked up to it. Lightning strikes, storms, trees taking out electrical lines, grids going out, all wreak havoc on appliances, and it seems as though these are happening more frequently every year.At first, when we began losing refrigerators and telephones from storms, I bought many $25.00-$40.00 Belkin and other inexpensive surge protectors for our home. Belkin's surge protectors are great for refrigerators, microwaves and telephones, but when it comes to higher end electronics, like your home entertainment items or computers, nothing compares to owning a better surge protector with the ability to clean and filter electronic or radio noises. There is a huge difference with not only greater protection, but your television picture and sound are absolutely pristine! I've used and compared the two and I'll never use a $25.00 Belkin surge protector to protect a $1,000.00 HD TV  ever again. We have Belkins all over the house, but not for our expensive audio and video equipment.This Panamax is wonderfully large with it's 10 plugs. Two of the plugs are marked for digital/video, 2 are marked for filtering, 3 are regular and 3 are marked for delayed output. (Even though the plugs are marked for specific things, you can use them any way you like.) There are two SAT/Cable in and out plugs, as well as Telco line plus and equipment plus for phone jack plugs. This Panamax is HD 1080 i/p ready with full surge protection, coax/sat protection, telephone line protection, automatic voltage monitoring, premium filtration, 12 v input and isolated banks. It has a trigger by-pass switch and an on/off power switch. It has an extreme voltage light and a protection ok light. Panamax gives you a Lifetime Product Warranty for up to $5 million dollars worth of your equipment if it should ever get damaged through it's surge protector.Having surge protectors on all my appliances saves me a fortune, as having to replace flat screen tv's and refrigerators is just ridiculous due to electrical issues which seem to happen more often than ever these days. I trust the inexpensive Belkin surge protectors for my kitchen appliances and phones, but when it comes to the really expensive flat screens, dvd players and computers, nothing protects like the better surge protectors like this Panamax, which also enhances your audio and video to give you the cleanest sound and picture you never thought possible!",2,2,0.015093454,0.03400139,0.9509052

"Let me say first, that this is the first case for my first Kindle. I bought it because of the low price and classic look. What I got was a well-made cover that I imagine will last quite a while. The case is lightweight and thin, and sturdy. The magnetic clasp is convenient and it is easy to slip the Kindle into.I'm pretty sure that the case is made of bonded leather (the leather equivalent of particle board) rather than a full piece of leather. The inside of the case is, I believe, a suede-like fabric, it gives it a nice feel and elegant look, and should not scratch the screen. I also like that, should I choose to keep the Kindle in the cover for reading, it easily folds back on itself. If it is, indeed, not made of natural leather then it may not hold up to frequent long-term use.The only reason that I can't say I absolutely love it is that I would prefer a pouch type case. I've been using this since December and I tend to only put the right-hand elastic strap (top corner) on, so that I can quickly remove the Kindle from the cover for reading--The case is small but it does add bulk and weight and it just feels so nice to hold the bare Kindle (points to Amazon for a solidly designed product). Even with just the one corner strap, the cover holds the Kindle securely (unless you're swinging it around like a madman).That said, if you do want a book type cover for your Kindle then you should definitely consider this one. For the price I doubt you'll find one",2,2,0.0008907919,0.0047299,0.9943792
"I built my PC around the AMD A10-6800K APU, the processor that is a CPU and GPU on the same chip. Built the system a little over six months ago, and during the time I was using the integrated graphics I was pretty impressed with its capabilities. The new Kaveri APUs were coming soon and I had planned to upgrade to the A10-7850K when it came out, and pair it up with an R7 250 in Dual Graphics Mode for a big performance boost. Yeah, those plans got derailed.AMD's R9 series cards had been selling on Amazon for a rather over-inflated price due to their popularity with Bitcoin Mining. The mining software uses OpenCL, which uses the GPU to crunch numbers at an incredibly fast speed. AMD cards are much better at OpenCL than Nvidia cards, because Nvidia cards are optimized for CUDA (which is the same thing as OpenCL except its not open source and only works on Nvidia cards). So I was shopping for the new APU when I came across this card and found the price had dropped below $200usd. I nearly went into shock.Using this card with the A10-6800K makes my system equivalent to a Core i5 gaming PC with the same card. My Windows Experience Index shot up from 5.9 to 7.9, a huge jump. I'm still an advocate for AMD's APUs, they're a great solution for PC Gamers on a budget.Over all the MSI R9 270 card performs extremely well. The Twin Frozr cooling solution is pretty quiet. Not like my friend's Geforce GTX 670s which are hair dryers. MSI has some great software for their cards for overclocking, perhaps some of the best in the industry.I'd highly recommend this card to anyone wanting to go AMD but isn't interested in an APU.",2,2,0.027075121,0.03615597,0.9367689
"iBook is the consumer notebook computer, which Apple offers.  I actually custom-configured mine at Apple.com, so mine varies slightly from the specs of the standard model listed here.  It is the same G4 processor, but I have a 60 GB hard drive, airport extreme card, bluetooth module, and I upgraded the iBook to 768 MB of memory.This iBook is a great way to step into the world of Mac.  However, even a veteran Mac user will find an iBook a great machine.  Do not allow the 1.07 GHZ chip to scare you.  This is a capable machine.  Furthermore, you can view all your favorite DVDs and burn CDs.  The size of the iBook is one of the fantastic features.  This notebook is small and light.  I use my iBook all over the house with the airport extreme card I added.  I might sit at the dining room table, on the couch, on the living room floor, in the office, or in my bedroom.I do recommend you add some memory to the iBook, which can add yourself.  The owners manual provides some instructions.  I would recommend adding a 512 MB stick, which will bring you up to 768 MB, but even adding a 256 MB stick, would be good.The iBook obviously runs Mac's OS X Panther (operating system). OS X is fantastic, with a lot of great features such as expose, iCalendar, Sherlock, etc.  However, the iBook includes other Apple software titles too.  iLife '04 is included, which has iTunes, iPhoto, IMovie, and iDVD.  iMovie and iDVD are the easiest consumer applications for making movies and burning DVDs.  They are fantastic.  Everyone loves iTunes, and iPhoto is hands down the best way to organize your photos.  What is so great about this?  You're iBook is ready for all of this out of the box!  Finally, Appleworks is included with the iBook.  Appleworks is a somewhat out of date program, but it can still get your word processing, spreadsheet, and other tasks performed.  However, if you want a top quality office suite, I would recommend you purchase Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac.Back to the hardware, the video out on the iBook is the only thing somewhat less than satisfactory in my opinion.  It has a mini-DVI output, and it includes an adapter, so you can connect an external display for mirroring via VGA connector.  However, the notebook's LCD must remain on the same time, cutting your video memory in half.  It isn't a huge problem for me, but the iBook does not have the extended desktop feature, when using an external monitor, that the Powerbook enjoys.Overall, the iBook 1.07 GHZ G4 system is an amazingly portable notebook computer with acceptable performance.  The included Apple software will keep you occupied, organized, and entertained.",2,2,0.0034167767,0.017851092,0.9787321

"Two tricks make this adapter really useful and versatile: a step-down converter ring, and one simple Photoshop adjustment.I got this adapter for my Olympus micro 4/3 camera, to try out as an alternative to a $600 true wideangle. I use it on my 14-42mm lens (28 mm equivalent at wide angle), with a 43 to 40.5mm step-down adapter ring to make it fit my lens. (With this lens, I have to say that the focus mechanism struggled to work--the motors on this tiny lens must be too weak to move the added weight of this adapter--and I therefore found it best to use manual focus. Other cameras may not have this issue).It converts my 28mm equivalent lens to what I roughly estimate is a 21mm lens--a big increase in angle of view.The big problem is substantial barrel distortion. Also, there is chromatic aberration in the corners and some vignetting (darkening in those corners). Now, here's the trick: Photoshop Elements (and, no doubt, other photo management programs) can eliminate the barrel distortion in: Filter/Correct Camera Distortion/Remove Distortion (try +20 to +30%). This has the huge additional benefit of pulling the corners out of the picture without reducing the wide angle of view--the very corners where both the chromatic aberration and vignetting occur! Crop to make the picture rectangular, and you have reduced all 3 problems significantly with this one adjustment.Now, you still are not getting top quality.

First was that it was completely bricked 1 week after receiving it.  This apparently was due to a firmware update (unlucky timing).  It took almost 2 weeks to push out a fix.  I found it disappointing that the firmware update was pushed out without enough testing (a lot of people were having issues). 2 weeks also seemed like a long time to fix it when it was working with the old firmware.Next it does still lock up occasionally (probably every 2-3 weeks).  This requires power cycling the device to bring it back.  Note to anyone that has this happen.

"PROS:The price for the specs are amazing. Features that are uncommon at this price range: phenom II triple core cpu, wireless-N, gigabit 10/100/1000 ehternet, HD4250 radeon discrete gpu, and 64-bit windows 7! That means you can upgrade to 8gb memory RAM and the laptop will recognize it instantly. Acer is good for the way they engineer the cooling system. This laptop is no exception. I noticed the keyboard has more travel and tactile feel than the same style of keyboard on an Acer netbook (I've used the Aspire one). Not too much bloatware pre-installed, actually some useful like netflix and ebay. Black mesh has a nice feel, doesnt attract fingerprints.CONS:The location of dvd drive is low, meaning my right hand always touches it when I pick up the laptop. One speaker, but ehh..just get headphones.

"The Eye-Fi SD Memory Card really is something to marvel. You can use it in any camera (still or video) that accepts SD cards. The images or videos you take can wirelessly transmit within seconds to either your computer (and remain organized with Eye-Fi included software) OR you can do something which I think is much cooler and more futuristic. If you carry a smartphone, all you have to do is download the Eye-Fi app and the pictures transmit to the smartphone. Within the app; sometimes with your smartphone itself, it is possible to upload the images immediately to a number of internet photo hosting sites. Your phone will also geo-tag the pictures if you wish.There is also options within the included computer software to transmit the photos to a PC (or mac) and then when the physical card is low on space and the photos are already remotely saved, they will begin deleting off of the card and you have a virtual endless memory card for your camera. This is optional but think of the possibilities.You're on a two week trip. You take 500 photos and never replace the card or delete off the card to make space and all of your photos can be waiting at your home PC when you arrive back, full resolution. Perhaps you have told your home computer to upload the photos to Picassa or Facebook during your trip, in real time. You can! What if you're hiking all day and don't have a cell signal or wireless connection? The card will wait until it has cell or wirelsss internet reception and begin uploading the pictures you have taken, automatically.Or imagine a birthday party for a small child his grandparents cannot attend because they live 1500 miles away. The grandparents could be watching videos of the happy birthday song, photos of the little one opening presents and pictures of everyone having fun at the party mere minutes after the videos and images are taken. The possibilities for sharing immediately or backing up remotely are endless.Maybe you take a lot of pictures but don't take the card out to load the photos to PC or tether your camera to your computer and organize your digital shots very well? No problem, Eye-Fi does all that for you. Set it and forget it. Maybe you take tons of shots but never get around to printing them? Tell Eye-Fi which ones you want printed via a website and prints are shipped to your door.This is really the future of memory cards and a solution to a lot of what I call ""digital issues"" like running out of space, not organizing photos by dates or locations well, and never getting many prints out of all of the great shots you take because you don't get around to it and it takes effort to organize and decide on the best images. I only wish they made a ""Memory Stick"" version as I would buy Eye-Fi Memory Cards for all of my beloved Sony Cameras. I actually began using a camera I long gave up on just because it used the SD card and wanted to try this technology.Yesterday, I was taking pictures, watching my Droid download them and then re-upload them to Photobucket and Facebook while it sent copies back home to my laptop- all full resolution where I wanted and smaller resolution for the web, as I had set it up and wanted. I decided to send a certain group of photos to my Picassa account in addition to my photobucket page. No problem.--Another note about Amazon regarding this specific order. I was anxiously awaiting the Eye-Fi card and watching ""My Orders"" page, tracking the package daily. One day, the tracking page said it had been delivered to my porch but nothing was on the porch. I contacted the delivery company and Amazon shipped a new Eye-Fi SD card to me almost immediately. Great service on this order with a great product. I hope Eye-Fi only expands it's products to fit every kind of digital camera. This is GREAT technology with really user friendly options that solve a lot of common digital camera obstacles.

"This bluetooth (wireless) keyboard / mouse combo is sold retail by Best Buy. You can get refurbished ones on eBay and through Amazon merchants. I purchased a refurbished one, and was happily surprised to find it in brand-new condition and in the original packaging.The package includes a bluetooth keyboard which uses two ""AA"" batteries, a mouse which uses two ""AA"" batteries, a bluetooth USB dongle, a manual, a CD containing the driver software for Windows, and four ""AA"" batteries.The keyboard is full-sized (actually a smidge larger than my desktop computer's keyboard), has a very solid feel, and is a bit heavier than I expected. It has the usual keyboard setup with a separate numerical pad, arrow keys grouped by themselves, Help/Del/Home/End/PgUp/PgDn in a group, 15 function keys across the top, and the Esc key in the upper left corner. It has a ""Windows"" key to the left of the spacebar. It also has 10 programmable keys running along the left and right sides of the keyboard, plus a full-width wrist rest. On the underside (which is bright red), it has the usual two legs along the top edge and a ""connect"" button (used to initiate syncing with the bluetooth-USB dongle or directly with the computer if it supports bluetooth). There is no visual indication if the caps lock or num lock keys are on. There is a single LED in the upper-right corner of the keyboard that flashes red when the batteries are low, or red/green when it is attempting to do a bluetooth pairing.The mouse is a little bigger and heavier than a typical desktop mouse. On the top, it has the usual left, right and middle/scrollwheel buttons. The scrollwheel can be tilted left/right, plus there are additional buttons on the mouse's crown with ""play"" , ""next"", ""prev"", and ""stop"" icons on them. There is a bluetooth ""connect"" button recessed on the bottom of the mouse.The USB-bluetooth dongle is provided to allow computers without built-in bluetooth capability to connect (pair) with the keyboard and mouse. It has a small ""connect"" button on the end, and a blue LED that flashes to indicate activity and flashes rapidly to indicate the dongle searching for the keyboard and mouse.I was able to pair both the keyboard and mouse with a Mac Mini both with and without the dongle. In addition, I was able to pair both the keyboard and mouse with a PS3 both with and without the dongle. In all cases, the pairing was easy, and I did not need to install any driver software on the Mac or PS3. To pair with the dongle, simply plug the dongle into the computer's USB port, turn on the computer so the dongle is getting power, press the ""connect"" buttons on the dongle, mouse, and keyboard, and wait a few seconds. The LEDs on the keyboard and mouse will flash red/green, and the LED on the dongle will flash rapidly, then all three will stop flashing. After this, the keyboard and mouse should ""just work"". To pair with a computer (or PS3) directly without the dongle is more involved, and generally involves telling the computer to search for bluetooth devices, then pair with the keyboard (this will probably involve typing a code on the keyboard that the computer provides) and the mouse (which should happen without any additional actions by you).The range of the keyboard and mouse appear to be at least 10 feet (the distance from my PS3 to where I sit). They both work well and without any glitches or surprises so far. I haven't owned them long enough to comment on battery life.Overall, this package is an excellent deal for the price I paid.",2,2,0.0012522805,0.0024075874,0.9963403

"The LEDs change color randomly and out of sync, making for some striking visuals. It's about nightlight-bright. The fan itself feels kinda brittle and flimsy though, the material is crystal clear and lightweight even compared to other clear fan bodies, and creaked ominously when I put the screws in. Simple sleeve bearing inside, might need a drop of oil every few months. Seems to blow a decent amount of air, not notably strong but good enough. It is a bit noisy at full power though, especially on an external mount.It's molex powered so it's easy to add on, but there's no tachometer and you'll need an adapter like3pin power to 4pin molex adapterto control fan speed. That's kind of a shame, because an app or BIOS that varies the voltage according to temperatures makes it a bit more interesting. Below 80% power it stops making noise, while still moving a useful amount of air. At 50% power the LEDs are dimmer and change color more slowly... with the right tweaking you can get a cool and subtle ""power-up"" effect when the CPU is at 100% and starts heating up.So why 4 stars, after all these complaints? Well, it really is quite beautiful, much better looking than other multi-color fans. It might not cut it as your main cooling fan, but it's great eye candy inside the case, and even prettier outside. If you don't mind a little fan noise, it's some serious bling for your buck.",2,2,0.009125997,0.20127638,0.78959763

"I'd give this camera 3.5 stars for the money.I arrived at the decision to buy this camera after a bit of circuitous route. Long ago I loved my old Nikon CP-990. Then I had a kid and for the first year or so it was ok. But after he started moving around on his own I found the camera to lacking in focus speed, frames per second and a few other tech specs. Not wanting to spend a fortune shooting him with my F3 Film camera so I got a D-70 and life was good, still is.However as he gets older and more adventurous we find ourselves in places I dare not take the ""nice"" camera. The pool, the beach, the sandbox, muddy days, the creek etc. At the same time my wife wanted a pursable camera so that we could have something with us at all times without lugging around a rig.So a pocket Point and shoot (PNS) seemed to be in the cards. I was all set to get the Pentax Optio WPi when Olympus announced the 720SW. It was good to 10 feet instead of 5 and was shockproof and had a form factor liked better than my wife (bigger LCD). So we held out and bought it. I've had a chance to play with it a couple of weeks and this is my impression.Pros-Small - Fits in the pocket/purse without issue.Faster than yesterdays PNS for turn on, focus and lock timeEasy to use - Has the standard full auto mode and some ""scene"" modes that are easy enough to figure out. They tell you what they are for and give sample pictures.Build Quality - I've never seen a point and shoot built like this. You could put this thing on the end of a chain and use it as a weapon and then take pictures of your vanquished foe afterward. Its tough. It has an all metal frame that surround it, the front plate is plastic, the back glass, metal and plastic. It feeds very solid. I haven't tested its robustness yet but its good.Internally focusing lens - You know those cameras that stick a snoot out when you turn them on? I find that somewhat annoying but more importantly I've seen those die when you get dirt or sand in the snoot. I've lost a couple of film PNS that way and seen a few digitals go down as well. Everything here is internally focusing. Its sealed, nothing to stick out or break off. I let my 2 year old play with the camera, he didn't break it but seems to instinctivally grip it with a sticky finger on top of the lens.Lenscap - The Pentax WPi does not have a lenscap! This one does. I once heard the salesman say ""oh but it has a protective plastic cover in front of the lens so it doesn't need one"" Ookkkay, so the lens doesn't get scratch, the cheap non replacable plastic in front of it does. Its still a scratch in front of your picture! The olympus has a more robust wiper type lenscap that can sweep stuff away instead of getting gummed up.Waterproof - This trick more than anything else is why I got the camera. Take it to the pool, take it IN the pool and get cool pictures. Pay the beach no head, splashing at bathtime, no worries. My son gooped it up pretty good, just ran it under the faucet and dried it off with a soft towel. Don't try that with your normal camera.High ISO - This camera can go to ISO 1600 which for its class is amazing. Higher ISOs make your sensor more sensitive but increase noise. ISO 800 and above starts looking very noisy and that's not uncommon in many digitals. Most small ones fall apart by ISO 400.Big Screen, Fast Zoom - It has a very generous 2.5"" LCD screen. When you take a picture and review it you can zoom in very quickly. Really great for taking a picture of a tourist map and taking it with you.Cons-Too small - Yes, too small. I'm not a big guy, my fingers fit ok but big guys might have some issues. Also the camera is so small and light its kind of hard to hold very steady. It doesn't have the weight to dampen your tremors and you really can get a good two handed grip on it, its always a finger hold.The ""Image stabilization"" - It promises no more blurry pictures because of ""image stabilization"". Well its not really image stabilization. When you kick that feature in it does an ISO boost (makes the sensor more sensitive to light) which lets you reduce the shutter speed so you don't have camera shake as much. The drawback is that you get more noise and less quality in your picture than if it had real image stabilization.Camera downloads kill the battery - If you plug your camera into the computer to download the pictures plan on charging the battery right after. It sucks it down big time. Get a card reader for $15 at any discount shop.Stupid XD Card memory format - It uses the ""XD"" memory format which is neither as cheap or fast as Secure digital or Compact flash. It's the same size as an SD card but different shape. Had to go get a new card reader to deal with it. Dowloaded about 5x faster. Most people don't have those cards laying around so plan on forking out some extra $$$.Can't zoom on video mode - When you start taking a movie you can't use the optical zoom, it can use the digital zoom be those are not too good.Review screen isn't all that pretty- Big screen but not great resolution. You can zoom in real close but it lacks sharpness. This might let you think the image is not sharp but it is.That sums up the pros and cons, but what about image quality? Does it take good pictures? Well I would say it takes ok pictures. I've seen better, I've seen worse. I've gotten somewhat used to Digital SLRs with good lenses so perhaps I'm not the best to judge. My wife thinks they are fine.For family stapshots of the kids by the pool or at the beach it is fine. Don't expect your photos of opportunity on vacation to far away lands to make the cover of a magazine though. This camera is at its best when getting the shot becomes more of an issue than getting it perfect.The best camera to use for any shot is the one you have with you. This little thing is a go anywhere do anything kind of camera. You can take it with you to the beach, the pool, on a 3 day hike through the mud and rain, across the desert and into the rainforest and not worry about it when you fall of your mountain bike doing it all..If it gets dirty or goopy find a bucket of water or a hose and wash it off.

I saw comparable products that had a shorter housing, which I would prefer. I also seem to have the world's loosest power outlets- no matter what I have in there it seems a bump jars it out and it has to be reseated- in the outlet, that is. The charging ports hold the cables snugly and are well made, and the blue power indicator is well thought out for vehicular use, being not so bright as to distract at night but clearly visible during the day.I recommend it.

"The ASUS router replaced an older Linksys WRT54GL running DD-WRT software.  The Linksys unit functioned well, had sufficient range for my purposes and was rock solid.  The only short comings were the 100 Mbs wired connections and a crowded 2.4 Ghz spectrum.  I am about to add wireless streaming to the TV and limiting that connection to a relatively crowded 2.4 Ghz spectrum did not seem like a good idea.I write communications software for a living and am well versed in networking.  Setting up the device was no problem except for the usual ""where did they put that settng?"" issues.  FWIW, I did not get it set up in 3 minutes like a few have reported.  By the time I had rebooted the cable modem, upgraded the firmware and checked the various client devices I spent over an hour.We do not have a large number of devices that connect wirelessly but there are phones, a tablet, an Epson Artisan printer and laptops.  All except a Lenovo T530 are 802.11G devices.  The T530 uses a 5 Ghz N connection.  All devices are working fine and both bands are used simultaneously.  I did find that I needed to re-enter my WPA keys.  I was not expecting to do that since I retained the same SSID and WPA keys on the router.The 1 Gbs wired ports allowed me to get rid of one of my two Gbs switches.  I do backups across the LAN and the faster connections mean the difference between 20 minute backups and multiple hour efforts.  There are 8 systems and an HP printer connected using wired connections.  An 8 port Trendnet switch provides the additional ports.I run a variety of OSes and none have had a problem with the new router.  In fact I did the router set up from a CentOS 6.3 (Linux) tower using Firefox.  I have upgraded the RT-N66U to 3.0.0.4.260 firmware.I do not plan to use the usb ports or the cloud storage.  I have existing solutions for printing, removable hard drives and cloud storage.  I also view the router as a security device and have concerns that the additional functionality would somehow compromise the devices security.  I'll note that I have no use for DMZ functionality at this time.I did set up WPA security and did the usual security configuration checks and changes.  I do use port forwarding for SSH Tunnelling.  I do not, nor do I intend to, use the VPN server.  The SSH Tunnelling is sufficient for my remote connectivity requirements and is far easier to set up.Unlike the firmware problems of a year ago, I find the current release to be stable and usable in my environment.  I spend a great deal of time on my job debugging other organization's networks.  I do not wish to repeat the experience with my home network.  So far the ASUS RT-N66U has proven to be a good fit for my requirements.Once I had switched to the DD-WRT software, my ageing but trusted Linksys router was very much a configure and forget device.  I have high expectations RT-66U will be the same.  If not, it will be returned.I would recommend the unit to other users with the caveat that this is a sophisticated device and I would think that an inexperienced user could be frustrated with the myriad of configuration settings.",2,2,0.16374415,0.14976338,0.68649244

"My need for this device was to extend signal strength in my new home.  I recently moved from California where houses are basically wood framed, to a new, larger home in Florida where houses use blocks for outside and load bearing walls.  This heavier construction, combined with the distance between my wireless router and where I use my computer, severely degraded my signal and throughput.  I purchased this device to rectify that problem - which it did.Installation, including putting it in wireless range extender mode, took mere minutes after unpacking it.  I was communicating with an incredible 100% signal strength in practically no time after setting it up, which was a dramatic difference from the 20% strength before it was installed. I did an experiment by walking outside with my laptop and was still connected to my home network with 80% or better signal all the way to the end of my property.I like the fact that this device seems to interoperate flawlessly with other vendor products.

"I've had a stereo surround sound system with no subwoofer for years. My small, cape cod style living room has plaster walls and hardwood floors, so I knew I didn't need anything large. I just wanted to add a little bass without  breaking the bank.This speaker is GREAT. It has it's own power switch and volume control for perfect balancing. It is about an 11&#34; cube in size, so it was easy to tuck under an end table and still point in a direction to bounce sound off the walls. It not only provides a powerful thump, but also a deep rich bass sound that I never realized I was missing.

"I originally bought a Polk TSx-250C but had to return it because it was too big for the space I needed it to sit in.  I went with this center because the reviews were good and I trust the Klipsch name.  So far it does not disappoint.  Since the speaker is only rated down to 88 Hz, I set my receiver to only send it frequencies above 90 Hz.  Dialog is crisp and clear and it's the perfect size for where it needs to sit on the mantel.  Also given its position it's above the listener's ear, but Klipsch gives you a screw to use to prop it up so that it faces the listener directly.  It's a small feature, but it shows they're paying attention to the fine details.The only thing I will say about this speaker is that it is a little small.  I had to return the bigger one I bought, so I knew I wasn't going to get the same depth out of it.  Don't get me wrong, this speaker sounds great.  But because of it's size, it lacks a little depth in the lower register which can make it not sound as &#34;warm&#34; as larger speakers in the same price range.If you're like me and you're a little tight on space, this speaker is awesome.  You won't be disappointed.  If space isn't a concern, I would recommend going with a center that has some large speakers.",2,2,0.00040729775,0.0041662604,0.9954265

"Having used this bar for several weeks now, enjoying all of the 7.1 Blu Ray movies I could acquire and cranking a few 5.1 audio CD's, I have to say I'm happy.  It's simple, discrete and powerful.Unfortunately due to physical law, soundbars will never give a better surround effect than a traditional 5.1 or 7.1 setup.  But who wants 7 speakers, along with 7 speaker wires sprawled around their living room?  Who wants to rearrange furniture to make room for gaudy 4' speakers, or knock holes in the wall to hide wires and tweeters?  Not everyone.This is the best compromise between a wife who loves her home theater, and a husband who loves the looks of his living room.Ease of setupThere were no scary drivers or anything I had to ""study"" when setting up, unlike other soundbar horror stories I've heard.  There are holes for mounting in the wall, but I have mine set up on the entertainment center just below the TV, and for being 40"" wide it's quite subtle.  Much better than my obnoxious 4' high 5.1 speakers which I'm considering selling.  The best part?  No more wires around the room!  I plugged all the wires into my A/V receiver, and wrapped them up with a zip tie for appearance.  I used the recommended settings for LCR levels, and the distance/delay setting just took a bit of measuring tape.The soundIf you're wondering why this particular bar costs more than others, I believe I've discovered the reason.  The sound is beautiful, and I'm not even talking surround.  2 channel audio playing off my .FLAC library sounds brilliant - the sound is wide, airy, and completely fills the room.  One caveat - get a subwoofer.  I have a cheap Sony that does the job, though if I weren't in an apartment I'd shell out for something heavier.SurroundIt's hard to explain the effect without hearing it, but I'll try. You know right away it's not stereo. Imagine sitting in the back of a theater - you can tell it's surround sound, the effect is just focused in front.  You know you're not getting the same effect of the lucky folks sitting in the mid sections, but you're content back there, with your xx-large soda and make-out partner.ConclusionIf I'm rating this against a traditional setup, I'm giving it 4 stars.  But if I rate it overall, including the quality of the stereo audio, the looks, the ease of use, and all the benefits of a soundbar over traditional, I have to give it a solid 5.",2,2,0.00030981944,0.001357452,0.9983328

"THE GOOD:  The LED screen is awesome.  The people look so real.  Compared to our 52"" Sony of just 3 years ago - this LG TV is hands down so much better.  The motion type remote is a worthy feature.  We mainly bought the TV for a bedroom.  We can now access our Amazon Prime videos, Netflix & many others.  One of the best features is the Plex Media software.  Running on my Mac in the Den it automatically shares all my movies and streams them without a hitch.  Setup was simple without a bunch of technical know-how.  The Media Center app is well worth the extra price.  Supposedly you can access files on a USB Drive but I have not tried that yet.  The iPhone remote control App was a nice surprise as well.THE BAD:  I'm having a hard time saying anything bad about this LG TV.  One small gripe is the Apps.  They mainly are corny.

"I went open source, converting all my Apple Lossless files to FLAC and bouth the Sansa Clip+ to replace my iPOD.  I'm an audiophile so I was looking for sound quality first and foremost.  I was also looking for RockBox compatibility and the ability to take expansion cards.  The Sansa Clip+ hits on all cylinders:Hots:* Excellent neutral sound quality.  Punch, dynamic, and balanced across the frequency spectrum, the Clip+ plays my FLAC files with tons to detail, but without being fatiguing or introducing distortion.  Bass isn't exaggerated (which may be what some people are looking for).  My only criticism is a tiny bit of grain in the midrange.  Lush and liquid this player isn't.  However I can readily live with its able presentation of tons of detail in a dynamic, musical, and easy way.* Tiny size and light weight.  It's attractive, easy to use, and incredibly portable.  This is a dual edge sword as I've already left one on an airplane.* Low cost.  Incredibly cheap, really - about the same price as a 32gb memory card.  This makes the pain of having left one on an airplane not that bad.  I just got another one right away.* Expansion card capability.  Takes 32GB cards.  I got 4x speed and have zero problems.  Multiple cards means you can easily carry a huge library with you - even if you use lossless compression as I do.  With a card installed, you see both the installed card and the native memory as two separate usb drives when you mount on a computer.* RockBox.  RockBox is a cool firmware replacement that lets you change skins.  It also allows the Clip+ to play more musical formats than the native firmware - including 24bit/44k wave files, which a friend mixes with.  Rockboxing allowed me to listen to these files on the Clip+ without conversion.  They sound great too.Rockbox is also faster than the native firmware.Nots:* Battery life.  I get 5-6 hours.  It's OK, but I would be happier with more.  This will probably be the first thing I hack.* Screen is low res.  This is quibble.  At this price and size you shouldn't expect a great screen.  And, indeed, for a pure music player you don't need one.* Volume button isn't the most responsive.  This isn't a problem per se - just an observation.  Forget adjusting volumes when you have your gloves on - unless they are very thin.All in all I'm completely in love with my Clip+(s).

"As long as the drive you want to connect is a SATA hard drive, this works perfectly. Because it uses USB 3, it is also quite speedy (if you have USB 3 on your system - otherwise it runs at USB 2 speeds).The only limitation I might see is that while larger 3.5"" hard drives fit the dock perfectly, smaller drives, such as those used in laptops, are quite a bit smaller and aren't held in place very well by the 4 sides of the dock. This isn't a huge issue if you just want to pull data off of a drive, but you probably wouldn't want to leave a smaller drive in the dock for a larger amount of time given you might end up bending it or something.Setup is easy. Plug the power adapter into the wall. Plug the power into the dock. Plug the USB cable into the dock, then the other end into the laptop.

"I tend not to like earbuds. Most of the sets I've used over the years have almost always made my ears sore as they have always tended to be ill-fitting with the speaker consisting of much of the bud. With the Monster Turbines, the speaker is reduced to a few mm across that are directed directly in the ear canal. Couple this with several different silicon covers, I found these buds extremely comfortable and was pleased how well the covers helped boost the sound coming out of the speakers while blocking out sounds from outside. The covers provide a great seal which improve and remove.The quality was really great. I found the bass deep to my liking, and a good treble balance. The sound on my laptop normally leaves much to be desired, but these headphones were quite comparable to my Audio Technica ATH-ANC7 noise-canceling over-the-ear headset.A big, unexpected bonus for me was that they work with my first generation iPhone! I don't have to get an adapter, which is what I had been thinking of doing. And they sound wonderful on it as well.The one thing I noticed is that if the ear buds move a little in my ear the sound quality changes. It's easy to fix (usually just a tap in the opposite direction will get the sound back to a nice level), but I can see this as being a little bit annoying if I decide to use them on the bus or subway.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a little money to spend.

"I bought a Tom Tom 1505 VIA to replace a stolen Garmin 765 recently. I really wanted to like the Tom Tom, but it failed to find many addresses and the POI was just as weak. So I returned it via Amazon and was quickly refunded. Then Purchased the Garmin 2350lmt. as I was about to embark and a 5000 mile cross country trip I needed a good GPS. This Garmin did everything I asked of it. Well , except it lacked a poi for Diesel fuel stops. The poi's are really useful , it is very quick and found every address I needed. Very quick to recalc my missed turns too. One thing I was very glad to find is the battery life is now useful, my old 765 was horrible, maybe 5 mins, this one is good for at least an hour, longer if you dim the display. I think I do like the interface of the Tom Tom a but better, but the Garmin finds the addresses and Poi's which the Tom did not.One poor spot is the suction cup, it would not stay stuck to the windshield no matter what I did. Fortunately I had the old one from the 765 and it was able to adapt to the 2350. It does stick and stayed secure for the entire 5000 miles. They appear to be the same but the rubber/silcone pad must be slightly different.I am very happy with the Garmin 2350LMT. I was a bit worried about the advertisements that others mentioned.

But the pad is divided in to pockets of crystal. So the pockets under the hot spot of the slate get liquified, the rest of the pockets on the pad remain solid. So I simply shift the slate to other area of the pad. With this method, I can use it for about 6-8 hours. So buy one or two size larger than your laptop or tablet pc.The pad itself gets warm after crystals have liquified. But it's actually cooler than the surface of my solid wood desk after two hours usage without the pad.",2,2,0.0035650837,0.02143728,0.9749977
"One thing's for certain, if you need to retrieve data from a drive, you need a lot of patience. Data Rescue 3 did a fantastic job, but I first had to clone the failing 2 TB drive and that took a couple days just to reach 90%. After a few more days of letting it attempt to clone the remaining 10% I contacted support by email. I needed to cancel the clone because it wasn't making much progress, but wanted to make sure that wouldn't cause the 90% that had already cloned to be incapable of being read by Data Rescue. Jeremy from the Data Rescue support team told me that canceling the clone was probably the best thing I could do at that point. So, I did.I did a deep scan of the new drive to see what I could recover. Amazingly, that took less than 24 hours and Data Rescue 3 found just about everything I needed. I lost a few files, but most everything was found during the scan.The actual recovery was fast, about 2 hours. I then tracked down all of the random files that appeared in the recovered folders and deleted those. The last part took a few hours, but it afforded me the opportunity to closely examine what was recovered and what was lost. I was disappointed with some of the lost files, but that's not Data Rescue's fault. Based on the success rate of Data Rescue, I'm very confident that this is the best result I could have had. A huge thanks goes to Jeremy and the rest of the Data Rescue team.",2,2,0.07698629,0.14954332,0.7734704
"I call the SD990 IS the ""baby sister"" of the Canon G10 which I also own and love (along with the 880 and SX110).  The 990 and G10 both have the same size sensor and number of pixels.  Although not as complex as the G10, the 990 offers some manual control as well.  I took both of them on a recent trip to Las Vegas, and I was impressed with them.  The 990 is great when I want something more compact and lightweight (purse size).  The picture quality, for what I was shooting, seemed equally as good as the G10.  The night shots of the Las Vegas lights came out fantastic with the 990 - extremely sharp and no noticable noise (probably because Canon increased the sensor size along with the pixel increase).  Even though the 990 lacks a wide angle lens, it more than make up for it with its image clarity and color.  I highly recommend it.",2,2,0.004220426,0.0108703645,0.98490924

"this item states it is made to be used for Windows 7, Vista, and XP. It is optimized for Windows Media Centre.If, like me, you utilize your computer for things like showing projections from a projector for work or even Halloween fun in the windows to make it appear that ghosts are floating through your home...some days you want a remote control for the computer.And this, at the time of my review, is an especially affordable way of making that happen.There is no learning curve needed.  Just plug and play: using your USB.  The range is 10 meters and the angle at which you can point it successfully towards your computer is 200 degrees.Many now use their computers for TV; especially those in college dorms may be watching movies as much or more from their monitors rather than their TV.  But, as a rule, we have grown to also appreciate the convenience of a remote for making things happen for viewing.When using a computer for work presentations that is no less true and this creates a seamless way of allowing the user to get more from any kind of presentation:  whether work or home TV viewing from the computer.Like a regular remote, it uses infrared to make it all happen.Product provided by Daffodil; this review is my honest and unbiased opinion.",2,2,0.001651256,0.0109314285,0.98741734

"I also took the plunge on this puppy during Black Friday/Cyber Monday week, paid $599.  I don't regret my decision, you get a lot for the money.  Notably a nice sized SSD and high resolution screen.  Windows 8 is OK,  a bit of a learning curve from W7, but have gotten used to the changes.  I've used the laptop now for a week, my first impressions are listed below.The Good:-Feels solid, heavy, but still very slim.  Nicely designed.-Very fast for my use.  Boot up, web browsing, excel, email, ect.-Screen.  High resolution, very bright.  Exceeded expectations.The Bad(feedback for the prod dev people at Vizio):-Hard to Open.  Not a deal breaker, but could be a nuisance for some.  That said, it does make it impossible to open for my 2yr and 4yr old.  An unintentional child proof feature.-Mouse pad software.  Pre-installed software stinks.  I uninstalled the Synaptics software and installed the latest version from their website.  The mousepad now works fine, not bad and not great.  Definitely room to improve overall.-Batter Life.  Ok, it's not bad, just not the 7hrs I was hoping for.  I get 4-5 hours tops with avg use(browsing, some video streaming, chatting).-Keyboard.  Feels flimsy.  Wouldn't want to type much on this.Windows 8:-Like I said, it has a steeper learning curve than previous OS launches.  I don't care for the start screen, but once on the desktop I can essentially do everything I need.  I kind of get what Microsoft is going for here(integrating all their devices/platforms), but don't think it was done well.  Maybe I'm just resistant to change, and this will grow on me, but so far am not impressed.  Would have preferred Win7.

"You are probably asking yourself if these headphones are worth the money. In my opinion, absolutely.

They connect instantly and have an amazing range. I start my music, put my phone on top of the locker, then hit the gym. I can cover the whole room, over 50 ft away and never lose signal. The sound quality is unbeatable and with very rich bass. The battery life is great, over 8 hrs of music. But what really surprised me is the built in mic you can use to talk on your phone. It's the clearest headset I have ever had, even better then ones that are specifically designed for a phone. People can't even tell I am on it.

That said, Mohu Sky is awesome.  It's like having the Leaf on my TV, but with slightly clearer and a few more channels.

"I returned the Kenwood DNX-5120 for this unit, and I am happy that I did.  For the price, you can't beat what you get - integrated iPod controls (with supplied cord), integrated Bluetooth, and MSN Direct service (when it works, which is usually for me - I live in NYC).  The sound quality blows away that of the Kenwood - it's not even a contest.  The voice recognition software is fantastic for iPods, although it sometimes doesn't work with Bluetooth (names only - saying ""Call 212 555 1212"" works every time.)  There is an entire website dedicated to this line of producs ([...] which gives you millions of different ways to modify the head unit to your liking.  It also helps to have tons of users at your disposal when you run into troubleshooting problems.Of course, there are a few cons.  The system takes awhile to start up, depending on the state you leave the car in.  For example, if you are listening to the radio when you turn the car off, startup time to audio is less than 7 seconds.  With CDs, its about 10.  With an iPod, it's about 30.  But if you were watching/using the map, it could take up to a minute to fully become functional.  A second flaw is the touch screen - it is a bit slow and finnicky for my tastes (nowhere near as fast as the Kenwood).  However, the wait times and touch screen response times are nowhere near as bad as people think.As this can be had for less than $600 online, it is truly a fantastic deal.  I returned the Kenwood and its Garmin interface because I was actually using the navigation much less than I thought, and the A/V interface was clunky and confusing, at best.  The sound quality and ease of use, coupled with a better-than-portrayed navigation system, makes this a no-brainer.",2,2,0.00067179993,0.002474599,0.99685365

"To begin, I purchased these on November 12, 2012. I went through three in a year and one even lasted nine months! The other two unfortunately did not fare as well as my first one, although one failed as a result of a dog using my phone as a chew toy. As I was going to leave feedback I noticed the Lifetime Replacement Warranty and decided to contact them on a whim. I received a very prompt response that inquired my order# and I responded from my phone, or at least I thought I did. It turns out that I did not and finally two weeks later as I was about to Email again to see what the hold up was I finally noticed that the Email did not successfully send. So I just responded to the Email again in hopes that they could still help me out. And, again, I got a very prompt response and after a few more exchanges (because I did not copy the order# correctly) they shipped me some new screen protectors!

Well my experience with Tech Armor was different since it was quick and they weren't trying to give me the run around. I had, I think, three different Customer Service representatives communicate with me and not once did I have to repeat my story, they were all aware of my case. I thought that was noteworthy.There are three protectors and they are of good quality. Before I contacted Tech Armor I had purchased some cheap ones, on Amazon, that shipped from China and after using both I can say that I prefer Tech Armor's more. The ones from China were a tad bent but installed easily (this was a plus). The only problem is, is that it does not cover as much area as Tech Armor's. It covers enough that it isn't noticeable to most people but with my case on I can tell and it bothers me immensely.

"[Updated: see bottom]I purchased this camera after reading so many positive reviews, but I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed and unimpressed. I am not a professional photographer by any means, or even a talented amateur. Really, I was replacing a older Sony Cybershot p&s; and all I really wanted was a camera that would be fast and responsive for normal family photos. Maybe I was wrong to expect the DSLR to replace my point and shoot with no bumps in the road, but that is the expectation that I went into this purchase with. I'll also preface this being saying that perhaps my lack of experience is partially to blame for my complaints/issues/problems/concerns, but I don't think it's unrealistic to expect a $400 DSLR on auto to perform *at least* as well as any P&S; would in the past 5 years costing significantly less.

About what should be expected for a Lithium of its size. no complaints there either.* Dual card slots: not that anyone would choose a memory stick over SD if they can avoid it, buts its nice to have both, especially if you already have some MS lying around (like me, from our older Cybershot and a Sony camcorder.)* Photo quality: Seems excellent when I can get the photos to come out clear (see below.) I am not printing posters or photographing for magazine publication so my expectations (and needs) were low anyways so take this with a grain of salt.* Zoom: I know this certainly isn't specific to this camera, but I enjoy the manual zoom rather than ""pushbutton"" zoom you get on every P&S.;* Anti-shake: Seems to work well - I have very unsteady hands and it always seems to come out clear anyways, except for the subject movement because...Cons:* Low light sensitivity: This is probably my biggest problem. I had seen other people complain about ""low light"" issues, but coming from a basic P&S; I didn't realize that ""low light"" basically meant ""indoors under any lighting conditions.""My living room (combo living room and kitchen open area) is about 400 sqft and has a total of 22 ceiling lights. Even with every light on, without the flash on the camera always wants to slow down the shutter speed to multiple second lengths. The anti-shake works excellent but my dogs/wife/child don't like to sit perfectly still for several seconds while unwrapping christmas gifts so this often results in nice sharp backgrounds with a big blur in the middle. If I put the camera into manual (which my wife would most definitely not put up with) I can get keep it at a normal speed but the exposure is too dark to be usable (which I do realize the very-smart camera had already figured out.) Ok, so why don't I just use the flash? On to...* Flash: the flash is nice and powerful. Way too powerful to be used indoors for any photo I have been able to take. It is so harsh that much of the photo gets washed out in white. I have since purchased the Sony version of the Gary Fong Puffer and this has helped quite a bit but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that I need a $20 piece of enormous white plastic clipped onto my camera to take a photo indoors.* Autofocus speed: While its decent and acceptable, its not really much faster at autofocusing (again, indoors under ""low light"") than my 5 year old Cybershot was. Same for the cycle time on flash - faster, but not by much. I will say that cycle time without the flash is blazing fast though, much faster than the P&S; could dream for.So, in summary, it is a decent camera, but seems to require to many work-arounds. I simply wanted a fast P&S; replacement, but it doesn't seem like that is going to happen.[UPDATE:] having used the camera for a couple of years now, I feel I might have been a bit harsh in my original review and have decided to up it to 4 stars. Some of my whining was simply from inexperience with it.Outdoors in full daylight autofocus is near instantaneous. Indoors is fast, faster than I gave it credit for really, but still could be better.Battery life is mediocre but within range of what Sony claims. The live-view really sucks the battery, but they tell you that up front. A second battery is a must.I do need to comment that the current price of $600 (as of 8/2012) is absurd. My purchase price of $400 at the time (late 2010) was reasonable.Performance is much better with the viewfinder than with the live view. I still use the live view most of the time because I'm not a photographer and hate the viewfinder thing, but for action shots the viewfinder is a must. The difference is night and day. The auto-review seems to introduce a lag before it'll let you go back to record mode.""Auto"" still is too slow for animals and kids, but running in Shutter-priority easily fixes that. After forcing the shutter speed I want, the camera does a decent job of setting everything else. Aperature priority works well too, though the kit lens is too slow to make any use of it. Ironically, I find this much easier to work with than the myriad ""Scene"" modes so popular. Maybe I'd like them more if I was taking pictures regularly of: A Mountain, A Flower, The Moon, or A Face. Oh, or a Sprinter. I saw one camera that boasted 26 scene modes. Really? That is supposed to make things easier than what amounts to about 3 items you need to set manually? But I digress.Autofocus selection is quite random and not very good at guessing at all, but using spot focus works well and it tracks well.It would be nice if the camera rotated photos when held vertically since it's sensors can obviously detect that, but oh well.Primary reason for upping the reason from 3 to 4: the availability of Minolta lenses. I see more and more DSLR and DSLR wannabees being released (including models from Sony) with proprietary lenses that all inevitably cost more than the camera itself. Thanks to the use of used A mount lenses on this camera, I was able to get a 50mm/1.7, 28-200, 28-80, and 100-300 for a combined total of $175. If I had purchased an E mount NEX model, one 55-200 would have cost me $250 new, and that is one of the more reasonable ones.",2,1,0.09242164,0.8114795,0.09609883
"Klipsch is a brand I was not aware of until I started looking at upgrading my old Sony home theater system.  After reading the Cnet review of the Klipsch Synergy Quintet III's I decided to make my purchase.The speakers arrived quickly from Vanns via the Amazon marketplace. The box was HEAVY, which surprised me a bit as the speakers included are two rear, two front and a center - but no subwoofer. Upon opening the package I located the manual - in several different languages - this document has a lot of very small print, but the actual info you need is about two paragraphs that say how to hook them up (positive terminal to positive, etc...). The warranty card is also there, and the serial number for the speakers is on the box.Each speaker is wrapped in plastic and nested snuggly in styrofoam.  Very secure packaging. As I took them out of the box I realized why the box was so heavy - each speaker is solidly built and very weighty.  The two rear and front speakers have bases that allow the speakers to be rotated side to side and up and down (ball/joint set-up).  The base on these speakers also allows for wall mounting if you like.I used 14 gauge speaker wire withGLS Audio Black Chrome Series Gold Connector Banana Plugs - 20 Pack (10 Reds & 10 Blacks)on each end to connect these speakers to my Yamaha AV receiver.  The speaker connections are made for these plugs and once the connection is made, they tighten down to enhance the connection.The sound from these speakers is undoubtedly their selling point.  I'm impressed! The old 'home theater in a box' Sony's they have replaced are absolutely no comparison.  I can't believe what I've not been hearing all these years.  Center speaker (properly dialed in on the receiver) provides excellent dialogue clarity and overall the speakers offer up a theater-like experience, as promised.I have paired them with theKlipsch KSW-10 10-Inch 225 Watt Subwoofer (Black)which really should be part of this package in my opinion.  Alone the speakers are great, but if you want to have that deep, rich base for movies and music, you need to add a sub.  I highly recommend the 10"" Klipsch, but be prepared to make room in a corner of your room for it.The reason I give this speaker package a 4 star versus 5 is simple.  I'd 'love' it if the package included the subwoofer, and had a $300 tag for both the Quintet III's and the sub. The rating I'd give the speakers, taking away the cost issue, would be a definite 5-star.  These are an amazing upgrade to my system in combination with the Klipsch 10"" subwoofer, and I'm very happy with my purchase.",2,2,0.030987633,0.05068085,0.91833156

"I've been into the whole MP3 thing for quite a long time (long before napster) however as much fun as mp3's are most MP3 portable players have miserable storage capacity. For me the Hard Drive units looked promising but expensive,but an MP3 CD player was something I knew I had to get.Researched, read reviews, and bought the SP250. No Regrets. Sound quality is excellent although I'd recommend getting a seperate pair of high-grade headphones. The two that come with it are adequate for the most part, but nothing special.

"This kit works well to hide wires. I won't go into detail because there are tons of other reviews.My only comments are:1) plastic flip out clamps on the white cover are fragile. I broke one on the two kits I installed. Be gentile.2) the lower plug sticks out far. This limits how close you can push a cabinet to the wall, unless you want to cut a hole out of the back of your cabinet or have open backed cabinets. I close to cut a hole out of the back of mine, since you can't see it from the front anyway (it is covered by shelves and components).3) one of my installs required cutting an addition hole in the wall to drill through a horizontal board (similar to a fireblock). This added a lot of time to the second install, for drywall patching and painting. Cross your fingers you don't have to do this, because otherwise the installs took me less than an hour each, and I'm a DIY novice.Overall, a good solution for the price.

"I was worried as I ordered this IPEVO Ziggi-HD USB document camera.  I live in Los Angles, and it was a quick delivery (2 days).  As I received the package, it added more worried, because it was so light and compact, and as I unpacked - I felt it more like a toy than a device.  But all of that went away after I tested out.  The height ajustment is enough to cover a full lenght (11&#34;) of 8-1/2 x 11 paper.  There are 2 settings for focus, C (continuous) and S (single). I had it set on C and it bother some as I move the paper quit a bit as I was writing, because it's auto focus so the camera is trying to adjust that all the time I the object is moved.  However, when I set the focus to S (single), it's much better, because it only focus the fist time I put the paper in, and as long as I don't change the height adjustment, then it's stay pretty much the same.  The only down side for this camera is it doesn't have a lamp / light, so you basically can't operate in dark room at all.  IPEVO should have intergrate a USB LED light.

"I have the old iPad mini and this case fits perfectly.  For functionality, there are many ways for you to make the iPad &#34;stand&#34; while in landscape position.

You can also flip and fold the cover to make it form a triangular base.The outside of the cover feels like rough denim (that should not be construed as a bad thing) and the inside feels like felt.  You can actually see some stitching on the cover, which makes the cover appear to be really well made.  On one side of the cover (in the interior), there is a rubbery band that allows you to loop around to the back cover to make sure the cover is kept closed.  I rarely use this though.

"I bought this wireless keyboard with mouse to use with my Samsung 55"" Smart TV. Typing and pointing with the TV remote is tedious and time consuming. Samsung recommended their wireless keyboard for about $100.00 but there were people who said you could use Logitech's K400 wireless keyboard and it worked even better than the Samsung wireless keyboard. The problem with the Samsung keyboard according to reviewers was that it wouldn't work very well with Netflix and other sites and was pricey.

"I'm a very long time Kensington trackball user.  I've been eyeballing this unit since it came out and considering replacing my expert mouse with it.  The wrist angle on the expert mouse strained my wrist at times.  Anyway, I received it this week and I'm pretty satisfied.  The hardware is very nice, solid, and it looks great.  Part of my hesitation was the lack of customization software.  In my opinion this has been a hallmark for Kensington going way back.  They had highly customizable buttons before anyone else did.  So anyway, that's there now with trackball works.  What I didn't realize until I started messing with it was this.On a mac anyway, you can configure it one of two ways.1. Use the downloadable driver and you can use the media and viewer mode functions.2. Use the trackball works software and get the ability to customize your buttons (there's a ton of options here).What wasn't clear to me was that these things are mutually exclusive.  So even with the fancy trackball works software, there's no way to configure it to function like it's supposed to out of the box (media and viewer modes).

"First, a few things to know before you buy, since Nikon doesn't tell you these things until you get your owner's manual:Regardless of the size of memory card, single videos are limited to 4 GB of space (The manual says about 35 mins at the highest quality setting; the camera itself usually says 28 minutes. I haven't come close yet to maxing that out, so I don't know which is more accurate).The user manual indicates that the waterproof packing in the camera may deteriorate after a year, so it is recommended that you have it serviced yearly to replace the waterproofing (at your expense).The camera strap is supposed to be removed for underwater use. So be prepared to hold on tight, or buy your own waterproof strap!Speaking of waterproof, the camera seems to live up to its billing as such. I tested mine in perhaps the dumbest way ever: I set it down on the wet sand in the surf zone at a local beach, held on tight and let an incoming wave surge over the camera. The video turned out very cool, but I had a huge, tedious cleanup job on my hand. The sand churned up by the wave worked into every crevice on the camera. Nothing got inside (the battery and SD card were clean and dry), but every button was jammed with fine grains of sand that had to be laboriously worked out. Worst was the wheel to open the battery door. It still scrapes a bit weeks later. Bottom line, I would seriously not recommend performing this test yourself. Just take my word for it, it doesn't leak. Using it underwater is fine, but you'll want to minimize the exposure to sand.Battery life: Good but not great. At Disneyland, I started the day with a fully-charged battery and by that night it was depleted to the point where the camera shut down. I did have the GPS and compass turned on most of the time the camera was on, and did lots of chimping and deleting of photos. I left the power-off setting at the default of 5 minutes. All in all I shot 65 photos and eight videos, the longest of which was 2 minutes and 48 seconds. You will want to buy a second battery for multi-day trips or if you plan to shoot all day with GPS enabled. Battery life with GPS off seems pretty good.Still image quality: Decent to good, but not great. It is a point-and-shoot, after all. The camera performed better than I expected in low light, but I wasn't expecting a lot. I should note that it's been about five years since I last used a point-and-shoot, and my reference point for image quality is a Nikon D700 SLR. I would say the image quality is about the same or a little better than the Canon Powershot A540 that was my last point-and-shoot. The camera does tend to overexpose, so I've taken to shooting at -0.3 or -0.7 exposure compensation.Video quality: Good. I shot on the top quality setting, and the video looks smooth and sharp on my 47"" HDTV. Like most small video cameras, every sound you make, including pressing the zoom and other buttons, will be recorded.Performance: Vibration reduction and autofocus work very well and there's virtually no perceptible shutter lag. I am very impressed by the Subject Tracking AF area mode. It follows the subject better than the 3D tracking on my D700.Recording formats: JPG only for photos (no RAW); MOV for video (Quicktime).Features: If you want a lot of control over your settings, this is not the camera for you. You can turn off the flash and autofocus assist, and you can adjust exposure compensation. But you can't manually dial in your own shutter speed or aperture, and there is no bracketing, although the camera does have an HDR scene setting (an option on the Backlit setting). I tried the HDR setting and it does make a notable difference in dynamic range. You will need a tripod or somewhere stable to set the camera for best HDR results; handheld, you'll get blurring. In Auto mode (which ironically gives the most control over settings) you can select white balance, continuous shooting modes, ISO sensitivity, autofocus area and autofocus mode.Additional observations: One omission that would be really nice to have is a histogram. Since you're forced to shoot jpg, it would be nice to be able to assess the exposure with a histogram. Mine does tend to blow out a lot of highlights and I've taken to knocking down the exposure compensation to -.3 or -.7Bottom line: A decent point-and-shoot. Buy an extra battery if you shoot a lot.If you have any questions I didn't answer, feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond.UPDATE: Interestingly, another AW100 user pointed out to me that the best image quality appears to come not at the full 16MP size, but 12MP. I've started shooting at 12MP and found it to be at least as good as the 16mp setting. I've also experimented with a lens hood and filters with good results. The hood and filters can be attached using the filter holder included with the camera. The holder takes 40.5mm filters. If you stack filters or use the hood and filters together, you will get some vignetting. Zooming in a bit (to approximately the 35mm film equivalent of a 36mm field of view) eliminates that. The hood I bought is the EzFoto 40.5mm Wide Angle Metal Lens Hood Shade for Leica, Contax Zeiss, Voigtlander and other Lenses. I also picked up a Hoya filter kit with UV, ND and circular polarizer filter, and Nikon's LC-N40.5 lens cap, which works with the filters (but not with the hood, which needs a 58mm lens cap). The polarizer is very handy and helps curb the camera's tendency to blow highlights. Filters and particularly the hood do make the camera a little bulkier. I leave the filter holder and polarizer on the camera with a lens cap, and carry the hood in my pocket for the times when it's necessary. I've uploaded photos of the camera with the filter holder and hood. I highly recommend at least getting a polarizer if you do a lot of outdoor shooting.",2,2,0.0133644985,0.06947722,0.91715825

"The mouse is great, actually the mouse if better than expected. The keyboard has some issues. The keyboard works perfectly but here are my 3 complaints.#1 The Keyboard is WAY WAY too huge, if I would have know it was this big I would never have bought it, I bought the Logitech N315 lapdesk so I could use the wireless keyboard and wireless mouse on my lap while my Laptop was plugged on my TV, but since the keyboard is was too big it takes up the space where the laptop goes + where the mouse is supposed to go too so I bought that for nothing.#2 The keys are a little too soft, when you press a key you don't hear that ""click"" sound that you hear with most keyboards, I think that not hearing that clicking sound is great but they should have made the keys a little bit stiffer because they feel too loose and that just doesn't feel right.#3 My 3rd complaint is the price, the mouse and keyboard combo is a little bit overpriced in my opinion. The keyboard and mouse combo is usually $60 or even a little more I got lucky and bought it when it was $55 but paying $60 is a little too much in my opinion, $45 or $50 would have been perfect.",2,1,0.22651002,0.71387815,0.059611876

"I picked these up on eBay for about $46 after my V-Moda phones failed to work properly with the iPhone 4.  The V-Modas would not advance tracks properly using the control button.The IDR655m includes a very nice tapLINE controller.  It's conveniently placed at the ""Y"" intersection of the cable.  The controls are easy to operate without looking, and offer a positive ""click"" with good feel and plenty of travel.  I have been able to control my iPhone 4 perfectly and consistently, using all the available control capabilities, including volume up/down, next tune, pause, play, repeat tune, and iPhone voice control.The unit comes with a good assortment of ear cushions.  I picked the largest single-cone type and they fit perfectly.  The ear cushions offer excellent noise isolation.  The cable is cloth-sheathed, which tends to reduce acoustic noise transmission associated with cable movement.  Also included is a very nice, padded, spring-loaded pouch which holds the phones easily.  The cable tends not to tangle, probably because of the cloth sheath.  Scosche also thoughtfully includes a well made cable clip that you'll need to attach yourself; it helps to keep the cable in place and optimizes the mic position.  (I placed mine on the right cable, where the mic resides, and clip it to my collar.)  Nice.Sonically, these sound fantastic.  Clean, powerful bass, precise mids, and extended high-end without any hint of shrillness.  If anything, these tend to sound a bit bass-heavy.I tested the built in microphone by making a phone call (Voice Command initiated, of course) to another iPhone.  The call was crystal clear.  The other end heard me perfectly, and there appears to be somewhat of a ""feedback"" loop that helps mitigate the ""occlusion effect"" - that quality of sound you hear when you talk and plug your ears.  In short, I don't feel I need to pull out the earphones to hear myself talk.  Very well done.  Also, the tapLINE controller volume controls work during a call, as well as the central control button.Build quality is very good.  The earpieces have a generous rubber strain relief which should help keep the cable from breaking internally.  The mini-plug cable strain relief is less pronounced, so I'm going to add a bit of shrink-wrap to that end.All in all, I am exceptionally pleased.  I am a musician and recording engineer, and find these an excellent value that hold up to phones several times their price.  Bravo!",2,2,0.00086046115,0.0021211202,0.99701846

"It can be difficult to see details to achieve focus in a viewfinder without a focus prism.  Since modern digital cameras rely on sophisticated auto-focus systems, viewfinders no longer include this traditional optical aid. I use this magnifying eyepiece in conjunction with a fine manual-focus lens. Although it provides only a 20% magnification, it it does help in perceiving the details of a scene. The quality of this Nikon eyepiece is very fine.NOTE: Then why only 4 stars? Although I can still see the information display below the viewfinder frame, and I can still see the edges of the frame in composing the photograph, the entire view that is visible when using the standard eyepiece cannot be seen all at once when using this magnifying eyepiece.  Instead, one needs look indirectly at an angle by shifting one's face relative to the eyepiece in order to view the edges; shift left to see the right edge of the frame, shift right to see the left edge, shift down to see the top edge, and shift up to see the bottom edge and the information display. I'm accustomed to steadying the camera against my face while composing a shot; this magnification eyepiece, however, prevents seeing the entire frame at once.  Just know that the trade-off is between being able to view the entire contents of the frame using the standard eyepiece, and being better able to see the details within it by using the magnification eyepiece.

And it actually simplified my whole setup. It allowed me to run all of my HDMI devices into this device and its output to the HDMI 1 input on the HDTV. Works like a charm. Other reviews indicated a need for a power supply when used with certain devices, but I certainly don't need one. I have a Panasonic plasma TV, a Panasonic blue ray player and a Roku XDS.

Note that you might want to do some research on flashes before buying one - there are larger ones out there which are definitely more capable - but also more expensive.For the price this is a great deal.

"I know next to nothing about microscopy, but did a ton of research at homeschool forums, and curriculum sales websites, and decided this was the best microscope to get my son thru homeschooled high school. If he needs anything more advanced, he'll get it in college. This microscope is just starting to get used, but it &#34;feels&#34; great. Very nice quality, size, and the features, while I cannot compare extensively to other models, brands, etc., seem like a huge bargain. We bought the camera attachment, so we can display on the computer screen, which makes some slides look like art. (which nature is, essentially, so beautiful)I wish I'd had this when the kids were younger, and had &#34;played&#34; with something like this, more often than some of the regular toys.

"I purchased one of these about a month ago along with a 55-200mm second lens. I started my photography hobby ""back in the day"" of developing my own film, doing my own color and B&W prints, etc. and loved my old film-based Nikon and RIcoh cameras. But as my life got busier with family etc I let that hobby go. But with the advent of digital cameras with good quality and good apps for computer editing I got back into. At first with the lower end cameras like a Canon G2 and Powershot models. They were convenient but photo quality wasn't that good and they struggled with many tougher situations. Plus my hold SLR hobbiest self objected to the lack of creative control. With the newer DSLRs that are available around $600 I took another look and felt the features and quality were ready for purchase decision. After comparing with the XTi from Canon I selected the Nikon because I found it's features easier to use and comprehensive. And most important the quality of the images is superior to the Canon. Canon's consumer lenses just aren't very good (at least not compared to Nikon). While I see some people are dinging this camera for sports I've had good luck using it for action shots. Unless you are considering buying a lens above 300mm I don't think the lack of in-body AF is going to be much of a real concern. Now, on to the best feature. In my tests the Nikon absolutely smokes in the Canon in start up time. With the Nikon, you can take a picture IMMEDIATELY after turning the D40x on. This is a huge feature for me and one of the reasons I wanted a DSLR. Also, the multishot mode works very well in capturing action. I'm really happy with this camera for the price!",2,2,0.017905682,0.035251487,0.94684285

I have small hands and I like that I can cover this mouse from heel of hand to fingertips easily. The left  and right click buttons were a little stiff when I got it but after a couple of hours they felt more comfortable to me. Scrolling took some time to get use to but now that I have used it for a while it works great. In a browser double tapping the middle of the scroll strip opens a link in a new tab. Single tap the middle and you can autoscroll. The sound of the strip when scrolling didn't bother me the way it did some reviewers and I didn't find it to be loud.

"I recently purchased a Sony BDP-S3100 to play blu-rays and my other video content, and this flash drive is a perfect fit.  The S3100 has a USB port on the front face that doesn't have a cosmetic cover, so the metal of the port visually stands out.  This drive blends right in with the rest of the black face on the S3100 to virtually disappear when it's plugged in.  I just load it up and then keep it in the Sony for extended periods.Cosmetics aside, it's amazing to have so much storage on a small drive.  And, as the pictures show, this thing is very, very small.  At 40, I remember the days of audio tape drives :), and I'm still astounded by how much storage they can pack into small spaces these days.One drawback to it being so small is that it can be difficult to extract from a USB port.  If the port is a bit tight, like on my Sony, it can be a real bear to get out.  I use pliers to pull this drive out because I have trouble getting a good enough grip on it.  A hint is to only push it into a port until the light on the front flashes (meaning it's connected), which isn't fully seated in some ports and is easier to extract.Overall, highly recommended for the price.  Big marks for compactness, storage capability, and good transfer speeds.  I dropped it down to ""I like it"" because of how difficult it is to extract from some ports.",2,2,0.00059354195,0.0013508875,0.9980556

"I bought this item to use for cloning and imaging my HDD in my Desktop PC.  It didn't work for my application but my requirements were specific.  I was interested in a SATA/USB interface (in place of of an Enclosure) to use with my 3.5 Desktop PC and my 2.5 Laptop HDD when booting from recovery media to clone and image full-disk HDD's.The item worked perfectly within my OS (Windows 7 x64).

However, the cable wasn't recognized with two of my Rescue media products, &#34;Acronis&#34; and &#34;Macrium Reflect&#34; (free version of Macrium).Since my requirement was specific, I returned the item to Anker and was credited the amount from Amazon.I rated this item a 5-star for these reasons:- Amazon's Customer Svc excellence as always for me, returning the item, crediting my acct, etc).- Anker's Customer Svc, in my opinion, rates very high.  I was contacted promptly when I sent an e-mail describing my issue with this item.  They understood my issue and asked me to return the item to them to receive a refund.I'd recommend this item for those that will be using it to interface with Windows 7 (and presumably XP or 8) for what the majority of customers would purchase this for, hot-plug capability for Sata HDD's for copying files, data storage transfer, etc.If one is seeking a device that will interface with bootable Rescue media, they may encounter problems with the cable not being detected by the Rescue software/platform.",2,2,0.0043824217,0.0066296016,0.988988

I have also found that by tightening the tilt nobs to snug, you can also adjust the tilt of the TV by grabbing and pulling or pushing on the bottom.I now have an incredible amount of adjustment available, especially since the swing arm allows the TV to extend a great distance from the wall.  I can turn the TV a full 45 degrees from the wall, allowing it to be viewed all the way from the next room.

"Update 7/2009:I don't believe that I am still using the W1. After 5 years and thousands of pictures, this Sony still works like new.  No problem no nothing at all.  I've upgraded to a Nikon D40 but I am still using the Sony very often. The D40 is just too big and heavy.  The picture from the Sony is still very good. The color from the Sony is very good. Just make sure you have the flash turned on at all time and condition, the picture will come out sharp and clean.  One big problem I have noticed over the years is that the picture from the Sony (when set to 5.1MP) is not 3:2  This is a big problem when I take the memory card to print at Costco. Costco chop the pictures from the top and bottom because the pictures are square at 5.1MP; not 3:2.  If you are planning to print the pictures, make sure you set the Sony to ""3:2""; not ""5.1MP"".I have been playing with this camera for 2 days.The speed is amazing. I can keep shooting and shooting with very fast shutter speed.  I turn the camera on and I can take picture right away. There is virtually no waiting from shoot to shoot.The camera is small but has a nice weight; and have a pretty good grip.It is very easy to learn and use.Compared the picture quality with my 3.1M Kodak, the DSC-W1 takes much better picture. My Kodak is pretty good but this Sony is awesome!And they cost the same.  The store has $40 off with this Sony. What a deal.The AE Illuminator is great.  I took a picture of my flower out side in complete darkness. The picture came out sharp and bright.But taking picture in door is very tricky. If the flash doesn't come on when taking picture in door, the picture is very fuzzy most of the time even the room has enough light (enough light to tell the camera not to use the flash).  But if I force the flash to turn on (even the room is bright enough), the picture comes out very sharp.  Never has this problem with my Kodak.  My Kodak can take very good picture in any condition except where it is very dark.May be the len doesn't let enough light to pass through.  Basically, in any condition (in door or out door; from dusk to dawn), if the flash doesn't come on, the pictures are usually dark and fuzzy.2 AA Alkaline lasts about 30 minutes. So, make sure you have enough batteries with you.  The rechargable that comes with the camera lasts a whole lot longer.  Sony gives me 20% discount after I register the camera in their website.  So, I will be getting the starter kit that comes with extra batteries.Using Memory Stick doesn't bother me since there is always something new every year.  And copying pictures to my computer is very fast.  I can just copy the pictures to my Compact Flash memory and take the CF to the store for the prints.The only bad thing is the software. It has no usefull feature but to let you copy and view the pictures from the camera. I can easily copy the pictures to my computer without the software since XP sees the camera as a disk drive; or you can set the USB mode to on-line camera mode (PTP) and XP sees it as a camera.Overall, one of the best point-and-shoot camera.  Just make sure you turn on the flash at ALL TIME.  And trash the 32meg memory stick that comes with the camera and get at least a 256meg memory stick pro.",2,2,0.020637073,0.039057516,0.9403055

"This is my 3rd, possibly 4th review on a Stylus. I started at the low end (Bag of 10 for $9) and when I reach for a stylus they are still about the house, but the tip was a little wide and the length of the stylus too short. I think I then moved up to another one which I believe was around $10, and it felt good, smaller tip, but after one day the clip (the one the keeps it in your pocket)broke. That one is around here somewhere too. This one (I got the blue)is the best of the lot, feels good in hand, smaller surface for drawing or writing, and they even sell replacement tips. I've had several customers ask about it, try it out, then ask me where I bought it.So, unless something crazy happens, as for now - this one is a keeper!",2,2,0.0013687025,0.002938345,0.995693

"Had an old Kensington Orbit - skipped and was full of crud.  First got a Logitech Trackman Wheel - - her hand was too small for the thumb control ball, and she wanted to roll the ball with the index and middle fingers - as this action seemed much more natural.  So we got this one with the ball in the middle.  Narrow base fit her hand great, and the buttons are configurable for right or left hand, as well as scroll lock.

"I stuck my neck out a little when I ordered the Sabrent enclosure. Some of the user reviews fussed about a loud fan or problems with screws, etc. After reading those, when I opened the package from Amazon I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice looking unit with a little heft to it and case that looked well made.I slipped in a good Plextor DVD burner that I had salvaged from a computer I had just scrapped,screwed the face plate on the enclosure and plugged in two cables and the power adapter and hooked it up to a USB port on my Asus eeePC netbook.It immediately read a CD and then played a DVD movie without any problems and with no further tinkering and without needing the tiny ""user manual"" leaflet that came in the package. Drivers included on a mini-CD are for Windows 98SE and are not needed with Windows 2000/ME/XP.Fan noise? In the unit I received it was virtually non-existent. Since the unit cost just enough to qualify for Amazon's Super Saver shipping, I paid no shipping charges. I'm extremely pleased with both the price and the value of this drive. I don't expect it to have hard use, and I won't travel with it, so I see no reason why I shouldn't be using it for a long time.

"Maxell manufactures excellent 120 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and just about anything else. These tapes have 120 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 60 blank minutes for recording on each side. This is useful when recording one hour radio talk shows, for example.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.There is one disappointment; however. These tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Moreover, cassette tapes--especially the 120 minute kind with its thinner than usual tape--can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you decide to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a superior choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell 120 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.",2,2,0.032244477,0.115753904,0.85200155

I will admit I've put on so many that I'm getting better.  The tip I got from the installation of this one was to use Scotch tape to lift the protector and another piece to get dust off the protector before putting it back down.  Tip worked beautifully!  In the past that one piece of dust would have ruined the whole thing.  I've wasted many protectors and came into this fully expecting to use all three in one go.  I have a satisfying application on the first one.  And I'm OCD.Tips I used from other applications.  Washed and dried my hands thoroughly.  I put a board over the cooktop and turned the exhaust on high to suck out as much dust as possible.  I also used a Post It brand note to lightly pick up dust from the surface.

"There isn't much you can say to review screen protectors like this. Really, all you have to ask are a few questions:1.) Is installation easy?2.) After istallation, is the screen protector bubble-free?3.) Does the screen protector work properly, keeping your screen scratch/blemish free?4.) Is the picture quality of the screen as good as if there weren't any protector on it?The answer to each of these questions regarding the amFilm Galaxy Tab 3 screen protectors is a resounding YES! Of course, whether or not installation is easy/simple and bubble/dust/fuzzy-free upon finishing will also depend much upon how well the user follows directions and how much of a perfectionist they are. Me? I'm a perfectionist, so I worked at it for a long while in a bathroom where the shower had recently run, with tons of scotch tape. The end result is a screen protector you can't even tell is there, protecting the screen without interfering with picture quality at all. What a nice peace of mind that brings. The fact the package comes with two protectors is just the cherry on top.

"I just bought a new computer: a desktop Windows 7, Intel machine (Ivy Bridge, i7 3.5 GHz) -a tower with plenty of room inside.  This is an every 4 year ritual for me, buying a new tower -I've done it every 3-4 years for 20 years (4 years = a tick and a tock on the Moore's Law clock).Part of the ritual is setting up a dual monitor display, which I've also had for 20 years.The past ten years I've used 3 and now 4 monitors (more about why in a minute).I am now using two large video cards inside my tower, both from ASUS.One is an ASUS GT520 and the other is an ASUS Silent 210.  I'll describe both here.(For my purposes they are functionally equivalent and both perform well.)Note: there are only two designers of graphics boards:  Nvidia (GeForce) and AMD (Radeon).I know GeForce best, since their low-end cards are more suitable for my lowly needs.Also note:  Nvidia Geforce is a design spec / chip set.  Those chip sets will then be usedby many manufacturers to make the various video cards you see on Amazon.(Read the GeForce wiki.)1) ASUS (Taiwan), as a board manufacturer. I thoroughly trust ASUS QA.ASUS is among the world's largest and best manufacturers of motherboards and video cards.In the past I've also used cards by EVGA and MSI that were also ok.  (Read the ASUS wiki.)2) Both the ASUS GT520 and ASUS 210 are totally silent.  They are fanless.(This is absolutely essential for me.) Instead, they have humongous, aluminumheat sinks.  I mention this, because they take a lot of room on the mobo.That's a key reason why I buy towers - to accommodate large PCIe cards.I've tested both  under light loads for a week now.  The GT520 heat sinkgets mildly warm, and the Silent 210, even less so.  Fans are not needed.(Don't stress over their power specs - they don't consume that much.)When I went to my local Fry's Electronics, I noticed that ALL of the ASUS Silent210 cards had been purchased previously, returned, and repackaged.I have no idea why.  (A guess is that other buyers may have discoveredthey didn't have room on their mobos.)3)  Both these graphics cards are totally overkill for me.  They are designed for gamers(that would be my son, eg), but are sufficiently low power that I don't mind.(Watch the fight scenes in The Avengers to see what graphics cards are really for.)4) It's essential for me to be able to drive 3 to 4 monitors. I was a stock trader for several years(a common ""non-game"" use of multiple monitors), but mainly have used them asan academic researcher.  It's a great convenience to keep open several pdfswhile participating in a video conference and taking notes, eg. BTW, once you've set upyour dual monitors, download MultiMon Taskbar (which is free and a godsend).5)  When buying video cards to drive multiple monitors, I strongly recommend shoppingonly from the Windows 7 compatibility list (if Win7 is your OS).  Both these are on it.I first tried an older card (a 6200) that had me in BSOD/ safe mode hell for a few hours.(Expect bizarreness on your monitors until you load the drivers of any video cards and reboot.)6)  Both these cards have identical output sockets: a DVI-D, a VGA, and an HDMI socket (for a tv monitor).I connect to the DVI-D and the VGA sockets of both cards.  All displays are extremely sharp.(I mainly cover cognitive neuroscience, biotech, and AI for my website bobblum.com.My goal is to smarten humanity, so that we are suitable companions/ pets for post-Singularity robots.)",2,2,0.006140774,0.0075019775,0.9863572

"Excellent product. I always clean the screen first with an ammonia based glass cleaner then spray it lightly before placing protective shield on. This allows it to float into position for those fine adjustments. It also allows you to remove it and re clean it without creasing it if you find some debris trapped under it. Once in place simply squeegee the liquid out from center to edges soaking up the fluid with a paper towel. A credit card or drivers license wrapped in a paper towel does the job just fine. It may take a day but eventually any liquid still trapped will dry up and become invisible. I use this method on all of my screen protectors and it seems to work the best. After 2 months of heavy use, my screen is still flawless. It cleans up easily and hasn't scratched yet.",2,2,0.00034697156,0.0015949036,0.99805814

"So this purchase was probably the ""hesitant"" of all my purchases on Amazon.  It's not an inexpensive product, and with a mix bag of reviews, it had me worried.  The primary purpose of this is to deliver impromptu presentations to a very small number of people (1-2).  Looking over my shoulder on my laptop isn't very practical.  Once I received the product, I charged it up and projected from my macbook pro onto my kitchen refrigerator.

"If you are looking at an external hard drive, you care about two things-- basic functionality, and reliability.  The Amazon vine program requires that I write a review of the items they send me before sending more stuff, which unfortunately means that I must write this review before I can really assess the durability of the product.  In two years or so, my computer might crash, and only then will it become truly clear whether or not this item has done its job as a backup.  Amazon wants me to write a review before then.  OK.I decided to use this hard drive for a ""Time Machine"" backup for my 2011 MacBook Pro.  The drive has 500 GB.  If you need a drive with that much space, you probably care about speed.  The drive has only one port, which is for a USB 3.0.  USB 3.0 is pretty good, although not quite what we were promised.  Nevertheless, most computers still don't have USB 3.0 ports, so if you are using this on something like my 2011 MacBook Pro, you are probably stuck operating at USB 2.0 speeds.  There are adapters sold separately that can convert USB 3.0 to Firewire 800 or Thunderbolt, and I would obviously prefer Thunderbolt to USB 2.0, but I am evaluating the item that came out of the box, which did not include such an adapter.  With a computer that has Thunderbolt, but only USB 2.0, I'm stuck with USB 2.0 speed.  My computer has about 320 GB of stuff on it (mostly music that I import from cd's in lossless format).  So, how did it work?  Out of the box, I plugged the drive into the USB port.  I was immediately prompted with whether or not to use the drive for Time Machine backups.  I clicked yes.  The computer said that doing so required erasing anything currently on the drive, and asked permission.  I granted permission.  Time Machine then went to work.  With USB 2.0 speed and 320 GB of stuff, it took about four hours for the initial backup.  If my computer had a USB 3.0 port, that obviously would have taken much less time.  Subsequent backups, though, are much faster for obvious reasons.  Given the computer, I would have preferred to be able to use Thunderbolt, and if you don't have a USB 3.0 port, you should probably look into a drive that gives you more options for connections.As I said, I can't really assess durability since Amazon requires my review before I can really tell.  All I can say is that this is Seagate, which is not a fly-by-night operation.  However, Amazon also sent me a Seagate 500 GB ""slim"" drive with only a USB 2.0 connection.  The USB 2.0 drive has a 3 year warranty.  This item only has a 2 year warranty, which suggests that Seagate may be less confident in this than in other models.  Beyond that, I'll have to wait to see how well the drive holds up.Overall verdict:  easy to use, possibly slow depending on your hardware, nice and small.  If you don't have USB 3.0, though, you might look elsewhere because you can connect a USB 3.0 device to a USB 2.0 port, but it will only operate at 2.0 speeds.",2,2,0.07347124,0.44528,0.48124874
"We get six microfiber cloths in this order.  Five of them are small (7"" x 5 11/16""), good for small screens and lenses.  One large one (11 15/16"" x 11 5/8""), for tablets.  I prefer the large one for all purposes.  It's the feel of the large cloth in my hands that wins me over.There are several things to look for when judging the quality of microfiber cloths.  They should have a good weight, a tight weave, and catch well (to pick up dust and fingerprints).To start, hold them up the light.  How well can you see the weave?  In densely woven fabric, I can't see it at all.  Can I see it here?  Yes.Do they stretch?  The large one does.  The small ones don't.  Lower quality cloths tend to stretch.How do they feel?  They catch my skin better than the cheapie cloths I own but not as well as one of my better microfiber cloths.  The less silky smooth they are, the better.What about weight?  It is 6 grams for the small cloths and 18 grams for the large cloth.  That translates to 230 grams per square meter (GSM) and 203 GSM, respectively.  The higher the GSM, the better the cloth.Most importantly, do they work?  Yes.  Occasionally, I have to pull out the big guns (my fuzzy fingers cloth); but on the whole, they take out the fingerprints without scratching the lens or screen.I like having cloths laying all over the house and car ready for me to use whenever I need it.  While not the best in quality, they are not the worst, either.  They do the job as intended.

"I purchased both the Mino HD and the Ultra HD to test and see which FLIP would be my camcorder of choice.  What I liked about both camcorders was the size and how easy both were to operate, the clarity was excellent and the software is great and simple to use.  After few uses of both camcorders I choose the Ultra HD and returned the Mino HD for the following reasons:The batteries.  When the batteries ran low on the Mino HD I had no choice but to stop taping and wait awhile for the camcorder to recharge which is a bummer if you are recording an important event.  Since the batteries are ""built in"" there is no back up.  With the Ultra HD the rechargeable battery can be temporarily replaced with regular 'AA' batteries to complete your recording.The Screen.  The Ultra HD has a 2"" screen and the Mino HD screen 1.5"". Doesn't sound like much but it sure is a big difference.Time:  The ultra HD has 120 mins while the Mino has 60 mins. Even though the Mino HD has now introduced the new 120 minutes recorder I still rather the Ultra HD because of back up charging with the 'AA' batteries.My only dislike on these camcorder is the use of the USB plug into the computer.  These camcorders depite their sizes do tend to ""bow"" slightly (if not placed on a flat surface) while charging or dowloading videos, which in time could cause damage to your camcorders and USB drive in your computer. It is best to buy the USB cables. Also there is no pause button which would have been perfect.Overall the Flip Ultra HD is my favorite when taping my kids at their after school activities. I highly recommend this item.",2,0,0.45785996,0.3182622,0.22387785

I had purchased one of these for my office and was happy with the purchase. I bought a second one for home. The only drawback is that the location of the USB cable coming out of the connector is placed on the left hand side of the USB plug so I can only use one of the USB ports on my Macbook Pro (can't use the USB connection closer to the video connector since I have an external monitor connected to the video port). You can plug and USB device into the end of the pad's USB connector but you still have a net loss of 1 USB port when the pad is in use. I've been meaning to get a USB extension cable to resolve the USB port issue.,2,1,0.058880974,0.5653064,0.3758126

"Why does this make me so happy?  Because the Giottos MH621 QR adapter mates up perfectly with the Manfrotto 357 adapter and plates. Both are a good value for the DIY'er. But at $30.23 (for Giottos MH621) plus 2 fluid levels on the mount how can you go wrong? I bought 3 of these for my DIY projects. I'm using them for my camera slider, camera jib and steady cam. I've read one complaint of the ""Plate locking screw"" only being able to turn half way. Well, it is spring loaded and able to be pulled out and readjusted. Of course there is a stopping block that can be easily filed off if someone is inclined to do so. One really nice inclusion with the mount is the extra tools and hardware. You won't have to carry around a coin if needing to remove the plate since the included plate screws have a flip up handle. A hex wrench is included for the added 3/8"" countersink screw for attaching the mount on a project of your choice semi permanently. The finish on the mount is more of a rough, flat matte as compared to the more satin finish of the Manfrotto, but this is not of concern. The fit and finish of the Giottos MH621 is nice.",2,2,0.0035799958,0.013969858,0.9824501

"Originally tried the Motorola S9 bluetooth headset.  Very cool looking and comfortable but could not use outdoors.  Constant cutting out while listening to music.  When I say constant, I really mean constant.  Then I tried a Motorola wired headset and had awful background noise and static.  Both of these headsets were returned.  Then I purchased this headset and what a difference.  Absolutely no cutting out indoors and very rare cutting out while walking outdoors.  I find the music quality better than either of the other sets.  I do need to up the volume for calls as the other caller can't hear me unless I do.  The voice quality I hear is superb.  The construction seems a little flimsy but I'm not rough with my gear and at least this one works as it should.  I was disappointed to see that the CNet review on this headset was not as good as the Motorola S-9.  This set is just way better than the Motorola.  The  Motorola even says in the pamphlet that comes with it, to keep the device  not around the waist but closer to the headset.  Even keeping my phone up  by my neck did nothing to improve the cutting out when outdoors with the Motorola set.Try this Sony headset and you will be much happier.",2,2,0.0037377598,0.028086005,0.96817625
"This is the lowest priced 2-line phone I found when I was shopping (it still probably is). I had a similar looking 1-line phone from Panasonic before and it worked flawlessly for 3+ years. It still does but I needed a 2-line phone, so I went ahead and got this one. It definitely met my expectations with same great voice quality as my old one. It's been 4+ months now and no problems so far. Here's what I really like about this phone-- Range is great, voice is crystal clear from any corner of my house (big house).- I can set distinctive ring tones, not just for different lines but also for different contacts which my old phone lacked.- The buttons are hard plastic which is much easier to use and gives you a better feel compared to rubber buttons on my old phone- Nice and compact form factor.Things I don't like about this phone-- It takes 4 clicks (2 different buttons) just to get to my address book.. and it usually takes several more clicks because you could easily click a wrong button. Menu navigation could have been much better.- Wish it had bluetooth but I knew that before buying it.- Wish it came with 3 handsets.. buying an extra handset separately is too expensive.",2,2,0.00040868687,0.0014792316,0.9981121

"...keep your expectations low!For a cheap shelf system this Sony can certainly crank...BUT with an ungodly amount of distortion and resulting listener fatigue above 50% volume mainly due to the lousy speakers (typical of all shelf systems) and subwoofer.  Keep in mind though that 90% of mass manufacturers like Sony, Phillips and Panasonic routinely inflate their watts-per-channel numbers to pull in the naive and uneducated consumer...Sony claims that the speakers do 125 wpc and the subwoofer 150 wpc but when you consider how quickly the sound distorts as you increase the volume, more realistic numbers would be closer to 40 wpc for the speakers and 70 wpc for the subwoofer.  Still impressive compared to the shelf systems of just 10 years ago, which had no subwoofer and were barely pushing 15 watts per channel---but no comparison to what even the cheapest low-end component stereo system can do!The subwoofer does not have its independent volume control so it does a good job as long as you stay well under 50% volume, go beyond that and it overpowers the music with its muddy boominess.  At low to moderate volumes the subwoofer does a decent job, though.  I ended up turning my subwoofer sideways away from the corner of the room where the shelf system sits, which did help to lessen the bucket-like boominess.All of the above is normal at this price point, right?  Well yes and no.  Compared to similar offerings in this price range by Panasonic and Phillips (I won't even mention all the Walmart off-brands) this Sony more than holds its own---in fact if those were the only choices I'd take this one in a heartbeat.HOWEVER...if you know where to look you can get a MUCH better component system for just an extra hundred bucks or so!  Go to jandr dot com for entry level Onkyo or Sherwood stereo receivers under a hundred dollars, DVD/CD players like the Toshiba 3960 for fifty dollars and bookshelf speakers like the Polk R15 or JBL E20 for one hundred a pair.  (As for a tape deck who on earth even uses cassettes anymore these days?)  This setup by itself will already sound three times better than any all-in-one compact system costing three to four hundred dollars, even without a sub.  If you must add a sub you can start with a cheap one hundred dollar Yamaha (or even better, a Dayton sub from partsexpress dot com) that will blow away this Sony's sub.About the only justifiable reason to get any compact shelf stereo is if you are truly pressed for space and money, and if you only listen to music (not too closely) at low to moderate volumes.With any compact system you will get a very limited range of sound-shaping options, for example this Sony only has 3 preset equalizer settings instead of allowing you to set bass and treble manually, and there is no balance control.  Also because everything has to fit within a tiny little box, there is bound to be more electronic noise and interference in the signal as the miniaturized parts are crammed much closer together, which is why the sound becomes fuzzier the louder you play music, and the unit can heat up if pumped at high volumes over any extended period of time.  Most importantly, there are much fewer connectivity options, meaning you can't hook up as many different things (video games, TV, VCR, PC, iPod, etc.) into the shelf system at the same time as you can into a standalone receiver...for instance with this Sony you only have one set of auxilary inputs.So that's why I think the extra hundred or so dollars would be extremely well spent.  But then again, if you absolutely cannot go over two hundred, this Sony is a very good choice in this class.",2,0,0.673287,0.30698407,0.019729005
"PLEASE READ ALL OF THE UPDATES BELOW ON THIS INSTALLATION.**********************************************************The product works beautifully and has solved all of the range issues in my 2500 sf home.  The setup on the other hand was a monster.  It just wouldn't work.  I called Linksys Cisco home support and was stepped through a manual process by a girl named Chloe.  She was great, patient and fully understood all of the issues.Like many other people who have reviewed this product, I received one with the faulty firmware.  Once that was resolved, the setup was beautiful.For the record, I am not a novice in computer networking. I have been involved in LAN development since the early 1970s and sat on the IEEE 802 committee for the CSMA/CD standards as well as the TIA Intra building wiring standards.  That said, no amount of knowledge of software and hardware components will help you if you don't have the tools to debug the software.  Fortunately, the vendor knows about the problem and the tech support person had handled this issue many times before.So, go ahead and buy it, but understand you may have to call the vendor to get it resolved. 1-800-546-5797 Cisco/Linksys Home Support.****UPDATE 1 - 11/26/2013****The RE2000 died.  Will not power up or boot up after less than a week.Called Linksys.  Went through a convoluted series of verification tests.RE2000 is non-functional.Sending replacement.Have downgraded to ONE STAR - Would make it ZERO if I could.****UPDATE 2 - 11/26/2013****I purchased an additional on year warranty from Linksys Technical Support because the unit had a faulty firmware chip.  Linksys assisted me in downloading an update to the device from their web site.  The device then worked properly for about two days.  I called Linksys again and they proceeded to verify that the device was completely non-functional and they advised me of their return policy.They wanted me to pay for the return shipping for their defective device.  I absolutely refused! I told them I would return the product through Amazon.  They then said that that was acceptable because I purchased it from Amazon and they would only provide free shipping if I had purchased it from them directly.This a ridiculous policy and I spoke to a supervisor and made sure she understood how I felt about this.It will be a cold day in hell before I buy another Linksys product.  If the replacement is non-functional, I will return it to Amazon for a refund.  I will not deal with Linksys again under any circumstances. I will purchase another range extender if necessary from another supplier.  IT WILL NOT BE BELKIN SINCE THEY NOW OWN LINKSYS!!!!Thank you for listening to me vent.*****UPDATE 3 - 11/29/2013*****Received replacement product today.Installed with absolutely no difficulty from CD ... No need to do manual network connection.Replacement unit must have the new firmware.On a scale of 1 -> 5, this setup was a 5, a breeze.Initial assessment is that everything is working as it should.Amazon Customer Support was exemplary in terms of replacing failed unit at no cost to me.I am changing my rating on this BACK to a Five Star, but I will be as quick to change it back to 1* if this device fails.  Hopefully Linksys has their act together now.Good luck and Happy Thanksgiving.",2,2,0.08563548,0.042126473,0.87223804

"I purchased this Canon T3i bundle based 100% on customer feedback and price.  I couldn't be more happy with it.  This is my first SLR camera and I have zero experience with still photography.First, you will NOT find a better price anywhere.  After receiving my bundle, I went to best buy to compare and verify the deal and I have to say I was surprised as I was relieved...  Here are the prices from Best Buy.$599.99  Canon EOS Rebel T3i$199.99 Canon EF 75-300 Zoom LensAlready saved $100 right there, but it doesn't stop with that...$15.00  Extra battery$30.00  Wireless Remote$35.00  16 or 32 GB HD SD Card (I picked up a 32 on sale but camera comes with 16)$10.00  UV Filter$20.00  Circular Polarized Filter$20.00  Florescent Light Filter$10.00  LCD cut to size screen protector packI'm not sure if the instructional DVD is included with the camera at Best Buy, but I saw the exact same DVD for sale on its own for $30.00.  The Tri-pod and carry case are crap / cheap and will need to be replaced so I give them $0 value, but hey they do work and you can use them until you save up to buy better ones.  I bought a real nice back pack case for $40.So not even including the cheap case and tripod there's an extra $140 in accessories.  So all in all this bundle saves you $240 over buying in retail at Best Buy.Now for the camera... WOW what a lot of fun.  Spent the entire paswt weekend in my back yard taking pictures of everything I could think of in manual mode.  I watched some youtube videos on how to use an SLR and I'm finding it a fun challenge.  I spent my Sunday out on the front lawn practicing taking pics of passing car license plates.  Within an hour I noticed a huge improvement in my focus ability as well as speed.  Like anything in this world, if you wanna be good at something you got to practice.  I would not suggest using this camera for the first time at your daughter's wedding.  Practice before you need it.  After a few days of using the manual mode I tried the Automatic and found it worked pretty good.  Pictures were taken super fast and the automatic settings were spot on in some cases.  My goal is to learn how to use it on manual 24/7.The built in flash is nice.  Provides a lot of light but from what I've been told, I will probably end up buying an external down the road when my skills improve.  But for simple party / dinner time use, the flash works great for me.The camera battery life is also very good.  I think I took upwards of 1,000 pictures on a single charge.  Over the weekend I only replaced the battery pack once.  I will say I did not spend much time reviewing the pictures on the LCD.In conclusion, as my first DSLR I couldn't be more happy with this Canon T3i and the bundle here on amazon.com.  In just the first hour I was taking some of the best pictures I have ever taken on any camera I have ever had before.  With all the accessories and things to add onto the camera in addition to an overwhelming (at this time) number of options and settings on the camera... I believe the camera will be all I ever need as an amateur / recreational photographer.I highly recommend the camera to anyone.  I also highly suggest that you practice, practice and practice.  ""RTFM""  Read The %&*@? Manual and/or watch the DVD and/or watch youtube.  I had 2 co-workers try and talk me out of purchasing an SLR due to their poor experiences, thank god I did not listen.

"This bag was just what I wanted.

Absolutely no problem with these cartridges they installed very easily what you should do to break the seal press gently at the bottom of the cartridge if you do that they will insert with just slight pressure. The colors seem comparable to the original Brother brand but at a fraction of the cost. I like the fact that Brother doesn't go to the extremes others do like to keep you buying just their brand of ink. One thing to note when ever you're buying these always look for the ISO 9001 from the manufacturer these vendors change so ones persons experience might not be the same as another but that ISO gives you a little since of confidence in the overall quality of the product. I've tried a few of these all with a ISO 9001 and haven't experienced any problems.

"This is a good camera for the price I paid, I got it on sale and so far I am pleased with the camera's performance. I would have given a five star rating if the camera came with better instructions. The printed material that came with the camera is sparse at best although the camera is easy to operate I had to learn some things the hard way. For example, I purchased a helmet mount bracket for mountain biking. The camera slides into the bracket via the grooves along either side of the camera (so the camera is lying on its side.)Going for my first ride the camera worked very well however the film was sideways and I was unable to rotate the movie and ended up deleting it. The camera has a lens that rotates but there were no instructions regarding this feature and how to use it. On my next ride I rotated the lens and my film came out very nice.Another example of poor instruction is the use of the waterproof case. Although the case works very well I had a difficult time mounting the camera and case to my helmet mount. After much consternation I finally located the small black plastic lock tabs that were preventing mounting. Had there been adequate instruction I would have been much happier.In the minimal instructions provided there is information about downloading Storyteller"" a program for uploading video etc. Storyteller takes a lot of time to upload your video. Additionally, in Storyteller is where you can make adjustments to your camera such as 720, 960 or 1080 filming and sound sensitivity. There was no information provided with the camera that explained this feature in Storyteller, I found it by looking around within the download. Camera does not come with any SD card, you need a micro SD card, shop around I found a micro SDHC (High Capacity) chip at a big box store that was 32GB for $24.99.Otherwise I am delighted at the performance of the camera the waterproof case was put to the test in recent heavy rain and rough trail uses. The only drawback for the waterproof case is that it dampens the sound pick-up. The camera comes set with a 720 HD default and the pictures are very good. The 720 setting provides the longest film time and least battery depletion. The 720 is so good I do not have a need for anything higher for the way I use the camera. The only other issue I have found is that there is considerable sound distortion in high winds or at high speeds (high wind). I realize this is an issue with all cameras I have encountered especially in outdoor sporting activities.My first trail ride was 46 minutes and the camera battery was fine for the entire time. I charged the battery after that ride and it took only about a half an hour. The camera charges via a USB plug. I recommend the camera if you can catch it on sale, the instruction provided is lacking but the camera appears sturdy, well-built and delivers very good video. The helmet mount is an extra that costs about 15 dollars.",2,2,0.00065879064,0.009826413,0.9895148

"I've never been an ipod user.  Don't like either Apple domination or Apple attitude.  Don't like the limitations Apple puts on its products nor the software it provides.So I've stayed out of the Apple empire.  But, I've very much valued portable mp3 players.My last mp3 player was a Creative Zen Vision: M.  It had 60gb of storage, some pretty nice video playback, and a decent software.  The hardware was a bit frustrating at times, as it could be a too sensitive pad, but it was adaptable.  Unfortunately, a while back (a few months after the warranty expired) I got a dreaded ""USB connection not recognized"" message when I plugged it in.  Everything else worked fine. But, I found out that these Creative players had hardware failures that blocked any and all USB connection.  Everything else worked fine, for a while, but I couldn't connect it to the computer anymore.  That defeats a whole lot of capability and freedom.  For a while I just used what was on it, as is.  That got tiresome.  To fix it, according to Creative, would have been several hundred dollars. No thank you.  No more creative for me.But it worked still as a player, so I couldn't justify spending several hundred for a new one either.Found this Fuze and thought that would be a great replacement.I couldn't be happier.  The video is not as top notch as the Creative, but that's okay. I have a laptop, and the screen is tiny anyway.  I never used video on these anyhow.The music plays great.  The player works with a variety of formats with or without extra software.  You can use Windows media or just Windows explorer to directly control the files and file structure.I got theDurable Flexible Soft Black Silicone Skin Case with Belt Clip and Armband + USB Car + USB Home Travel Charger + USB Data Cable for Sandisk Sansa Fuzefor under ten dollars to go with it, and that adds protection and different charging options.  Quite pleased. Though, if you're paying for this great silver, you might not want to use the silicone skin.I also got an 8gb microSDHC for under ten dollars.  And with this really took advantage of one of the Fuze's great benefits. By having microSD slot, the player not only becomes expandable, but also quite easily flexible.  Have different cards handy, each with particular content.  The player is then easily expanded to an unlimited degree.Very pleased with the music quality.  The provided earbuds are mediocre, but that's not surprising.  Given the significantly lower price of the Fuze, it becomes quite feasible to buy more high quality earphones. Which I did.  Got theEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (Black)and couldn't be happier.One major frustration was the lack of real playlist support.  It becomes awkward to import playlists, especially as WMP only recognizes the player itself rather than any microSD card (another downside).  There is a 'golist' that can be changed in the player itself, but that's pretty limited function.  I found a way around this, however.  There is an option in the player to ""play all"" in any given genre.  I just changed the genres of the albums, and now have built in playlists, of sorts.  Quite pleased I can play all my jazz, or all my classical, or all of any other standard or made up type without having to pay attention to the player.The interface is really simple.  But, the scroll wheel is a step up.  Very easy and clear to use.Overall, I'm quite pleased.  It lacks some functionality of the major players, but more than makes up for it in price and use of the microSD slot.Much more pleased with this than I ever was with my Creative Zen.A great purchase.",2,0,0.36046612,0.30910447,0.3304294

"Schiit Bitfrost is so far the most surprising audio equipment I have ever owned.  I used to have Wyred4Sound DAC2, PS Audio DLIII Cullen Stage IV mod, Apogee Duet (firewire version) and a few other DACs in my system so I kinda have the standard performance level of DACs by its price range and I didn't expect much from this little budget DAC at all.  But WOW, it really surprised me!!!  W4S DAC2 may have slightly (very very) better bass than this one, but other than that, Schiit has great high, midrange, soundstage (both width and depth) along with very decent bass (actually very good).  I don't even miss Cullen stage 4 mod DL III at all (I actually prefer Schiit, and the only other budget DAC I liked was Apogee Duet although Schiit is better).  I also quite an experiences with April Eximus CDP, DP-1 DAC, Electrocompaniet DAC, Meridian DAC, DacMagic, Olive music file player etc. at my close friend's music studio (both my frienand I didn't like April DP-1 that much, maybe too much hype).My system consists of Sony SCD-XA5400ES SACD player, Audio Research LS-16 Mkii preamp, ATC SCM20 powered speakers, PS Audio power conditioner etc. and I am driving this Schiit from Mac mini through optical TOSLINK instead of USB (PureMusic+itunes+lossless files).  Althoguth TOSLINK can support up to only 24bit 96KHz sampled PCM, it sounds awesome.  If you are looking for a decent DAC around $1K~1.5K, check this out.

"This is a very reasonably priced tablet for what it is. The WIFI and GPS are flawless on the one I have. The new update is super fast and I absolutely love it! I cannot wait for Jelly Bean to come out because it will be even faster. Those who say it's expensive compare it to the Nexus typically because they both have a Tegra 3. Don't be fooled they are not near the same chip. The one here can go from 1.7GHZ-1.9GHZ. That's really fast compared to any other tablet on the market. Many of the tablets that have 32GB in it are going for $600+. The iPad is stupid compared to this. Let me explain. I bought a 32GB SDHC card on Amazon for $20 making my tablet now a 64GB for $519.99. Can't beat that because the iPad cannot be upgraded with any type of memory. Now the update they just did allows SDHC cards up to 64GB which they run for about $45 making your price for a 96GB tablet $544.99. You really can't beat that compared to the iPad. I will give you one further. Get the Keyboard! It extends the battery life further than the iPad and it's a keyboard/stand/screenprotector. I bought the Prime's keyboard TF200 if you don't know. It was $99 at Best Buy. So for $618.99 I bought this, the keyboard and upgraded it with a 32GB card. Still better than any other price on the market and the keyboard features a usb port which I can place my giant 2 TB harddrive and play my DVR shows and they look the same when played on my friends iPad 3. Don't be fooled by the HD screen you can't tell the difference between the HD screen on this compared to the HD screen on the iPad it's too small of a difference.

"I had been struggling between: sigma 17-50 IS, Canon 24-70, 24-105. The two Canon L lenses are not wide enough so I bought the Sigma but I was not so happy and returned  you can find my review for Sigma there).I never though that I would buy the 17-55IS that is EF-S, expensive w/o a lens hood, not L lens build quality, no RED ring and now I am writing a review for it. I won't do much comparison between this and Sigma since it's not fair for the Sigma at much lower price but you know I have tried the Sigma so you make your own judgment.After receiving from Amazon, the first thing I tried was the zoom ring and it was disappointed and felt nervous for paying that much for the lens but after a couple shot at wide aperture then the fear has gone. I started with by battery test shots, kids' eyes and the focus is dead on, I kept checking if I set it at F/2.8. Then after 300 shots in my sister's wedding it becomes my new favorite. I just have the lens less than 2 months so I couldn't comment on the dust issue( will update after one year). Here is my personal mini review for the lens, first two are equally important:- Image quality: very sharp and even at F/2.8. I rarely shot at f/2.8 with my old sigma 18-50Macro and normally I have to go to F/4.0. Color and contrast are more subjective and could be fixed with PS but I just view the shots from this lens over and over with my IPS screen. I am using LR and my default sharpness is 30, rarely go above 35 because it will be scary.- Focus: this lens focuses quick and accurate, maybe I am lucky but I'd say all my canon lenses are good. The focus ring on the Canon 17-55 travels more than the one on the Sigma 7-50hsm and ring doesn't rotate and that could explain why the Canon focus is more accurate. My speculation that the Sigma can easily miss the target with a small overshoot. The Canon focus seems to be much faster. When I had the Sigma 17-50, I wasn't impressed with the focus speed although it has HSM. Majority of people test focus accuracy with camera mounted on tripod but my way is to point to targets the shoot and that's how we take pictures right?- IS: almost silence and very good. And because the 17-55 IS is long, it's more noticeable when I have IS on.- Build quality: I wish it had the RED ring. I think the build quality is decent and much bigger than the Sigma version. The size could be a con especially with the lens hood on but I think Canon decided not to compromise the image quality for smaller size lens. Let's wait and see if I have dusts in my lens.Well, the 3 out of 4 things that I listed above directly affect the image quality and Canon designed them right.What I don't like about the lens: my first complaint is the zoom ring, why such an expensive lens has mediocre zoom ring? I think the lens size is related to achieving the image quality so I don't care. Canon: please include a lens hood as you do with L lenses. I got $10 lens hood and it works fine, fits perfectly.To answer your question whether to go with $1100 lens or $600 lens? then ask yourself what are important to you then you know the answer.Final rating: 4.5 stars",2,0,0.70269036,0.1908076,0.106502086
"One thing I really like about the bag is the number of pockets and slots it has, you don't have to worry about things banging around loosely.  Based on some of the reviews I thought the bag would be smaller than it was, it was bigger than I expected.  All but the largest laptops should fit easily, I had no problem fitting my HP ENVY with a 15 inch screen.  Nice professional look with a shoulder strap that allows it to double as a messenger bag. Will update as to the durability.Another great part was I didn't have to deal with two boxes, the one it came in and the shipping box.  Because it was an Amazon Warehouse Deal that I got for half the regular price, it came repackaged in a poly bag but absolutely nothing wrong with the briefcase itself.  Honestly if you are not shopping Amazon Warehouse Deals you don't know what you are missing, most of the time the only thing wrong is the items come repackaged and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the item itself.

"These little headphones deliver powerful sound, plenty of volume and a good strong bass in a compact package.  I played a variety of music from rock to classical and while I was pleased with their initial performance, I had some minor reservations.  The notes were not quite as clear and distinct as I would have liked and I detected some muddiness.  Believing that the headphones would benefit from an extended break-in period, I began the process.  They're several hours into it at this point and already the balance has improved and the sound is cleaner than before.  I have no doubt that they will only continue to get better.Although the sound is of paramount consideration, another reason to love these AKG mini headphones is their comfort.  Because they're small and light (4.2 oz.), you barely know you're wearing them and unlike earbuds, even after hours of wear, they never become annoying.They're presented in an attractive molded case designed to keep everything in one place and protect the headphones from damage when not in use.

got this as a replacement for a more expensive brand that got damaged when a wind came up at a park shoot. It's just as well made as the 2x higher priced product. Maybe better. The removable cover has nice  end covers for the  metal ribs. it works very well with my  strobes. the  color balance is fine and has no color shift in the strobe  lighted shots. I think the umbrella ribs are built  a lot stronger design than my  old model. I love using a 60&#34;umbrella  with infants. it gives a very soft light that really enhances a baby's skin.

".....it would be a mistake to discontinue the classic iPod nanos.  The thing that made Apple famous initially was not the iPhone.  It was the iPods aka nano devices that were essentially just MP3 players.  These died out once the iPhone could essentially do the same thing + be a phone + have apps, etc.  The dilemma cell phone users find themselves in today is that there are now Android phones being made which are essentially better and more customizable phones than the iPhone.  Nonetheless, for music lovers, the iPhone beats their butts, as it's music easily organized on iTunes, uploaded to the phone, pulls pictures of your artists, etc.  Nice and neat.  Trying using the minor-league rookie apps on a Samsung Galaxy, including the inferior 'Google Play' app, and you will realize the iPhone music app is better.  Try uploading, organizing, and editing the file names of music you've downloaded in a Google Drive or MS One Drive of Dropbox, and you will realize why the iCloud beats all other cloud's butts in terms of easily and conveniently getting music to your phone.  Yet do we really need a cloud (which basically just holds more music we can't fit on our phone anyway) when a device such as this classic Apple iPod classic holds 160 GB?  The answer is no, especially since knocking out the iCloud can save you $25-$100 per year.  Also, is there some rule that says we can't have 2 devices and that our phone must be one and the same thing as our MP3 player?  If you're like most people and you just listen to music in your car, when you exercise, and certain other moments and don't have to have it with you every single minute?  No.  I would have never owned an iPhone were it not for the classic iPod.

There is (in my opinion) warmth and a surprising level of accuracy. Other reviewers' comments about there being less power when not connected to an electrical outlet is on the money. Just the right size, easily portable, could use a better pouch than the one provided but that isn't something to complain about at this price. Well worth buying.",2,2,0.00035588452,0.0012675285,0.9983766

I dont know much about these tablets but my son does. i bought it for him for christmas. He loves the darn thing. I have to admit the display is beautiful! I keep asking him if he needs anything else like programs but he says there is a slew of them for free out there. cool!. When he connected it up to the wifi it was very speedy. people have complained about it being slow but this one wasnt at all. On initial startup it updated the operating system to the latest (jelly bean something) level. It was a little pricey but you get what you pay for. this unit is very solid feeling and very thin and light to boot. maybe ll tablets are like this but I feel I can trust sony.

"I travel internationally very often and I would find that the headphones given on the plane were just really bad.  I'd turn the volume all the way up and still couldn't hear.  I just couldn't stomach paying a couple hundred bucks for the Bose headphones.  I bought these based on previous reviews, just did a flight to Bangkok last week and was AMAZED at the difference.  Are they as good as the bose ones?  Probably not, but honestly, if you are looking for something that the non teckie people like me need, these are really great.The ONLY thing I will say that is annoying is they have a strap across the top of them that is supposed to be stretchy and hold the headphones in place.  It presses on the top of your head and was instantly annoying (especially when you are on a 14 hour flight).  In 5 minutes I had a sore head.  I literally snipped it off and pulled it out immediately and never missed it.  The fit isn't as good, but again, we are talking about a very reduced price.  I would suggest walking around and wearing these for a bit to see if you can tolerate it, or just snip it off.",2,2,0.00054353353,0.0014811957,0.9979753

"Let me first say great picture and sound quality.  I hooked it up and put on a few shows and it was excellent quality.  The sound was pure and crisp so no problems there. Two screens that stream whatever you have playing on your ipod to the backseat where the kids or friends are waiting.  If you want to listen to music instead of whatever you play for your passengers you have to hook earphones from your ipod and run them to the backseat.  This set up comes with a two way split so you can hook two earphones into the split and give them to at least two passengers.  The only problem is the power source is through your cigarette lighter so no hooking it into a wall at home unless you buy a seperate adapter, but why would you want to do that. So in summary the only power source is in your vehicle and if you want to hook up earphones you had better have a long enough cord to reach your passengers.  If your ipod is charged you could easily just put it in the backseat because the power cord is just under three feet in length and should reach depending on your set up in your vehicle.  Finally to play around I started hooking an Aux cable to see how it would work.  Aux cables stop the sound from playing through the screens speakers and changes it to your vehicles speakers which is nice for sound but will force the driver to listen to what ever movie or youtube video the passenger chooses.  The cord needs to be small and not to large of a head because it is right next to one of the hook ups and you really have to get it perfect for it to fit.  Next I played a game hoping to see it on the screen in case you want to show your buddies just how to beat that angry birds level and sadly it does not divert the video to the screens so it is a strictly movie and tv show only gadget.  Youtube does work fine so you can share those funny video's as you drive.  Next I played some music and it does play through the speakers on the screens but does not show the album work.  So lets say you have an old vehicle that has no radio well two birds with one stone, tv for the kids and a radio for you.",2,2,0.0008373867,0.007963642,0.99119896

"This device is far superior to the basic Logitech eyeball I was using before.  The picture quality is excellent, and it's easy to hook the device onto the computer or anything else.  The one glitch is that the camera has a hard time staying focused with a moving object such as a toddler or baby.  I didn't notice this problem with my Logitech.

"First, I'll mention delivery.  Arrived a day earlier than estimated fr Amazon.  Wasn't ready for that.Aside from the Viewsonic reputation, the 23"" panel was more suited to my desktop space although I was prepared to go with a 24"".  I guess the clincher was the USB hub for four devices...printer, scanner, camera and MP3.I've not generally been impressed with flat panels until this IPS model.  The combination of great reviews and pricing finally convinced me to send the heavy 21"" NEC graphics CRT I've used for years to the recycling center.  This is a panel that finally surpasses CRT performance.  Wasn't ready for that either.Native resolution is excellent.  Color accuracy and gamma were excellent right out of the box, particularly as I use this for commercial photography and vector graphics.  Setup with included cables is ridiculously easy and no real need for the Viewsonic CD driver under Win7.This thing is BRIGHT.  Certainly not ready for that.  Two possible solutions to reduce eyestrain: set to sRGB or ""conserve"" in the ECO mode (6500K).  Not that it affects my work, but vertical off-axis brightness is inconsistent.  Horizontal is fine.

It's not lined up very well on mine, either.- You have to take it out of the case to sync it or charge it.The saving grace is that it's very easy to slide the zune in and out of the case.Overall, I don't regret buying it.

The Montana has matched its accuracy for Geocaching and logging road navigation so far.I really like the touch screen and I'm learning to navigate the pages and menus.

"1st, BELIEVE THE HYPE !  The image quality is TRULY AMAZING! GORGEOUS, TRUE to LIFE COLORS! They are about as close to a 35 mm photo as I have seen (including those from cameras costing 3-4x the price!).  The salesman at my local WOLF camera store (who is very knowledgeable) was surprised that the pictures I developed were from a (3 MP) digital camera.  YES-THEY ARE that GOOD.  And I am not easily impressed (anymore).2nd, I am by no means a ""novice"" when it comes to digital cameras.  I have lost count as to how many cameras I have bought and sold over the years in my futile attempt at finding ""the perfect camera"".  It is my belief now that there is no ""perfect"" digital camera that will fulfill ALL of your digital needs.  You need to prioritize what's important.  For example, if video with sound is very important to you, you can rule this camera out.  However, if image quality ranks HIGH on your list, please keep on reading my review.  I have tried all of the really tiny, expensive cameras and have ultimately, always ended up disappointed by its picture quality.  My ""BIG"" camera (which I highly recommend) is the Panasonic Lumix FZ20.  This has become the perfect ""take anywhere"" camera for me.  I like it better than the Sony P200 that I paid over 3x for.3rd, a term I just coined for this review is ""megapixel smegapixel"".  Four years ago, I paid a thousand dollars for a top-of-the line 3 MP camera (Nikon Coolpix 990).  To this day, that camera has taken some of the best pictures including those from 5 MP cameras like the Nikon 5200 or even 7 MP camera like the SONY P200.  The thing is that the higher the megapixel, the higher the incidence of NOISE.  99% of us do not need a 7 MP camera.  It's simply overkill and the pictures, ironically, often end up looking more GRAINY than a picture from a great 3 or 4 MP camera!  Even though this is ""only"" a 3 MP camera, that is enough resolution to print up to 11""x14"". So, don't get too caught up in the ""megapixel race"".  You just end up paying a lot more for something that you don't even need! This camera proves that you don't need to spend $500 to get a great digital picture.Finally, like all cameras, there are the ""cons"" which other people have alluded to - namely, the short battery life and relatively long shutter speed.  If you are trying to capture a toddler on the loose, this is NOT the camera for you!  But I find it more than acceptable.IMPORTANT: NOW, FOR THE MAJOR ISSUE OF BATTERY DRAINAGE - I read ALL of the reviews on Amazon IN FULL and no one has yet mentioned that it can also use CRV3 battery which lasts longer than rechargeable ""AA"" batteries.  Or even better, that for $30, you can now purchase rechargeable CRV3 batteries !!!!!  My favorite is the one by MobyPower, sold here -[...]Also, I always use use a Card Reader to download photos from my cameras instead of draining battery power. I'd recommend you buy a separate card reader - they are very inexpensive and will save you lots of money on batteries!Fianlly, I paid less a tad over $100 for mine.  In my humble opinion, dollar for dollar, this is simply ONE of the BEST DIGITAL Cameras out there.  Whether you are entering the exciting (but often intimidating) world of digital photo,or you need a great Second Camera, this camera should more than satisfy you, without leaving a dent in your pocketbook!IMPORTANT UPDATE : As of April 2005, If you want video with sound, you can buy their NEW 5 MPG D-595 camera for only $50 more !",2,2,0.013630126,0.017945694,0.96842414

"I have several WD portable drives, but this one is the thinnest by far, easily half the thickness of an older 640GB WD Elements drive I use.The specs say this drive is 3 times faster that USB 2 and they are correct. I ran a side-by-side test against myLaCie d2 Quadrahooked up as USB 2.0 on my work PC (For test data, I'm using an i5-2310 w/16GB ram, 128GB SSD & Caviar Black as an internal storage drive). On that internal storage drive (I'll refer to it as a WD Black), I had a 5.7GB Outlook PST archive file, perfect to test with. From WD Black to this new Passport Edge it took 65 seconds to fully copy, meaning, when the popup window with progress bar actually closes. From the WD Black to the LaCie running on USB 2.0 it took 205 seconds for the same file to copy. Please note that Windows was showing the same 120MB/sec transfer rate for both the Passport Edge and La Cie drives initially, but the La Cie copy started to fall off down to 65MB halfway through the copy, and once the progress bar was done it hung there for another full minute. Those speeds on a USB 2.0 drive seem unrealistic. This is simply because the progress bar and data transfer rate are guessed at while programmimg (it's what I do for a living), it's not easy nor efficient to try and accurately calculate what data running on and off drives will do. THEREFORE, the most accurate test is simply this: how long does it take to finish, and the PassPort Edge on USB 3.0 is a full 3x faster, taking 65 seconds, where the La Cie 2.0 took 205.The software that WD included is quite impressive, I think I'll actually keep it installed and use it, lol. The installation and setup is easy and well done. Upon startup the software tries to think for you and is set, by default, to go find your docs and images and back them up. If you keep your stuff in all of the My Docs and My Pics that's default with Windows and you don't want to have to think about the backup, then this will work well (BTW, Mac Users: there is a folder of Mac versions of the utilities, I can't test them but I assume they work equally as well being that WD has been doing this for a while). There's a second setup option where you specify which folders you want to monitor and backup, and THAT'S what I chose for the installation, and tested. I turned off the Security installtion option where your data is encrypted and password-protected, the last thing I need is another password to remember, and if I forget and the data in encrypted, forget trying to crack all of that. HOWEVER, the Backup worked extremely well and quite quickly. It's just like DropBox or Carbonite, basically it monitors the folders you specify and when there's a new or changed file, the WD service that's running syncs your folders to the Edge drive, just like DropBox. I rather like that, I'm used to running homemade batch files and doing my own file backup with a ROBOCOPY script. So, kudos for WD on this one. The user interface is well done and pro looking, not the usual odd look you get when engineers in tech companies attempt to write software (whoa, that should spark a few comments, lol!). One last note about the software: there is a service that keeps things sync'ed of course, but it also has drive health feedback. If you hover over the icon in the systray (little icons in the bottom right of the screen), you get a transparent popup message titled ""WD Quick View"" that displays the storage used and the actual operating temperature of the drive, very helpful.As far as reliability, that I obviously can't tell yet. However, I'm going to leave this thing plugged in and running 24/7 with my PC and in a few months I;ll try to remember to update the review, there are several I revisit (yep, even non-Vine ones!)

"I bought these in-ear earbuds to use while exercising, and they haven't disappointed me.I have very small ears and the smallest earbud cover fits well.  These earbuds are slightly curved and stay in place through all my activities, provided the cords are not pulled (which goes for any corded earbud, not just these). Construction is indeed premium as advertised, these are well made and all connections are sturdy. Sound quality is excellent all around, with very good isolation.The only thing that stops me from giving these earbuds a 5-star rating is the cord.  It's the typical smooth plastic-coated type of cord that tangles.  If these earbuds were to come with a tangle-free cord, such as the cloth-covered tangle-free cord found on some Snuggbuds models (which are superb earbuds -- but they're also twice the price), I would not hesitate to give these earbuds all five stars.

"I got this case for a a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10. As others have mentioned in reviews, the case is just a bit tight for the Lumix cameras. It's difficult to squeeze the camera's strap into the case, so I just leave it hanging out. Not a big deal. The case zipper will catch the on/off switch and turn the camera on, so it's best to invert the camera in the case, so the zipper passes over the bottom of the camera instead of the top. If the case were about 1/4&#34; wider, it would be absolutely perfect. Still, it's a nice quality case. The carabiner is one reason I bought this one. It also has a belt strap. It has a good amount of padding for such a small case. The pocket is large enough for a an SD card, but not a spare battery. I bought it for its small size, so can't expect it to hold everything. Overall, a very good case.",2,2,0.0134401,0.3293535,0.65720636

"A hard drive is a difficult thing to review.  I've used it for a few months now and it hasn't failed, so that's a good thing.  Performance appears to be solid.  The fan noise is not noticeable.  The case styling is nice and slick.The one major negative preventing this from being a 5 star device is that there is no off switch.  I use the hard drive as a network drive attached to my router.  When it's plugged into the router, the hard drive is always spinning and never goes to sleep.  The fact that it never spins down is an issue with my router firmware, but still the hard drive should have an off switch for times when I know I'm not going to use it.  Now I have to unplug the hard drive from the router and power source to get it to shut off.  You should never ever leave hard drives on and spinning when they are not in use, that's a very good way of killing your hard drive very quickly.I did not use any of the software included with the drive, it is just not necessary.  Each operating system would have much better backup software then whatever is included here. Also there is no reason to call this a Mac hard drive. It can be formatted to any file system and used on any operating system.  The fact that companies advertise things like hard drives as Mac specific just annoys me.  Usually it comes at a higher cost to take advantage of users, but trust me it is practically idiot proof to take any external hard drive, plug it into a Mac and format it so it can be used on the Mac.",2,2,0.0007819844,0.008776212,0.9904418

"Got one today from Amazon. I've been playing with it all day and like it a lot. Similar to my LX3. I got up to speed with it pretty quick  and have been having fun with it. Shot about 20 macro photos with no focusing problems. Not a fan of in-camera editing, preferring to just get the RAW file and head to Photoshop. But...some of the options in the 'artistic' mode on the LX7 are worth messing with. Now if Amazon gets that required (ugh) $30.00 'filter adaptor' (that should have been built-in or free with the camera) I can proceed to go on off for another $40-50 for a B&W; UV filter to protect the lens, something that wasn't easily possible with the LX3 without buying one of those tubes and keeping it on all the time. I have an optical viewfinder (24mm) that sits in the hot shoe of my new camera and is helpful shooting outside in bright light and looks cool. No complaints.Update.I should address the lesser video capabilities of the LX7 v. the LX5. I realize everyone doesn't feel this way but it wouldn't matter to me if no still camera had video capabilities, in fact I'd prefer it. As others have noted, there is no perfect camera. I'd leave the speakers off this one too as well but I realize competition being what it is the video horse has left the barn.  Unless something totally unforseen happens, I'm going to like this camera for quite a while. It focuses faster, in fact it has a high speed focusing option that speeds things up considerably from its predecessors, it should be left turned on in my opinion.I'm very happy with this camera, I could have bought the new 20mp Sony or the new Samsung or any other camera of that class. I'm glad I stayed with the Panasonic.",2,2,0.0046416335,0.02480817,0.9705502
"My Onkyo Home Theater in a Box (HTIB) center channel was having trouble making enough quality treble to easily make out voices.  The bass was also lacking so deeper male voices sounded weak.  Since we watch a lot of shows and documentaries consisting of mainly dialog, the center channel seemed a logical choice for a first step in the upgrade process.  Deep bass is nice but I also have neighbors to consider, my thinking was that with coherent treble and a good mid range, the lower frequencies afforded by bigger speakers wouldn't be too dearly missed.The center is one piece of the larger Polk TL350 set of speakers and is the satellite plus an extra woofer.  It contains a lot of tech that has trickled down from their higher end speakers (LSi?) like the ring radiator tweeter and an aluminum phase plug.  Check out the SoundAndVisionMag.com review for more details.My real world impressions have been good.  Some family was visiting and they put in the Inception blu-ray. Eyes and ears were glued.  This thing probably puts out more bass than my sub, even if it can't get quite as low.  I now actually listen to music again (Neo:6 Music on my amp) as it's just so detailed and I don't need to crank up the volume to hear it.  It's easy to get wrapped up obsessing about display technology and skimping on the audio as I did when building a home theater but balance is important.  This center channel is a good start.The Polk CS10 at a hundred bucks is probably a better value but it's enormous compared to the TL3 Center.  I like that this speaker doesn't dominate the space beneath my TV.  The TL3 seems to have a lot more technology than the TL2 so the extra money seems worth it to me.  There is no real manual that comes with this speaker so you'll need to resort to Polk's awful website, which looks like it was designed by some exec's ""computer guy"" nephew.  That said, the information is there.Bottom line - This is a massive upgrade over my HTIB center channel, so much so that it makes my remaining cheap speakers sound almost irrelevant.  I've never listened to a $1000 center channel speaker, and probably never will, but I'm confident that the TL3 is near the point where returns start diminishing.",2,2,0.0025762445,0.021425497,0.9759982

"I did a lot of research before buying a projector and DVD player for our basement theater. I have run 16mm and 8mm films for 30 years and was leary of video projection. I finally decided on the H31 because most of what we watch are old 3:4 black and white movies on DVD. I don't like TV and have no interest in watching HD programming. I did purchase the upscaling Oppo 971 DVD player to get the film-like look.The projector was a huge disappointment when I first got it. I bought a Gray Wolf II screen to go with it, and I discovered that I could not put the projector on a table or in my projection booth (about 4.5 feet off the ground. If I did the image was projected on the ceiling. When they talk about a 35-degree lens offset, that means a huge amount of upshifting of the image. We put the projector on the floor and still had to point it at the floor for it to fill the screen, which hangs down from a 7 foot ceiling.I bought a ceiling mount from eBay and it is a piece of garbage. It will not hold the adjustment, although it is made of aircraft grade aluminum. Don't fall for that garbage. It's a lightweight, overpriced mount and it doesn't work. It cost $20 to ship it and cost him $4.30 to actually ship. Take my advice, bit the bullet and buy the Optoma mount.After fussing around and drilling about 10 sets of holes in our ceiling, we finally got the projector in a spot that doesn't produce huge amounts of keystoning that can't be fixed. This projector has very limited zoom and lens shift controls, so measure carefully because you will not have much in way of flexibility. The image is still a little cockeyed on the screen, and it bugs me, but no one else seems to notice.They are blown away by the image quality. This projector requires absolute darkness and no more than a 92-inch diagonal screen. Turn on the lights and it's really bad. Use a larger screen, and it gets bad. Also, you should have a ceiling at least 9 feet tall to use a mount. WE are really hurting for ceiling space in my installation; I had planned to put it in my projection booth, but that just doesn't work with this huge lens offset. What were these people thinking when making the offset so large?For the money, this does give a very good image. It works well in our small venue. It's not the projector to buy if you want the lights on, if you want a huge image or if you have a ceilng where you can't drill a ton of holes trying to find the best location that doesn't produce a cockeyed image with a lot of keystoning (keystoning controls only do so much and it seems to cut off a portion of the image when using them). The lens shift feature on the projector is worthless (cuts off portion of the image.It runs hot but isn't noisy. Focusing seems sloppy and the zoom is pretty lame. But again, it's only $600. I figure we'll use it for a couple of years and toss it when the bulb burns out. By then, the HD projectors will be $500.",2,0,0.75825804,0.1923754,0.049366586
"The best sub-$200 mic out there. Mounts directly onto the cameras hot-shoe and comes with a good quality shock mount and extra bands. There's an optional filter which I've never used but the typical full-on provides great quality audio which I've used on location, in studio and for a few minor foley sounds. Upwards from this I'd still recommend Rode with the NTG-2 and beyond that it's Sennheiser but then you're getting to $500+.A few drawbacks: the coverage area is a bit wide, it's mono (not stereo) and the cord can cause some awful noise if you don't wrap it carefully.",2,2,0.0014431395,0.02301516,0.9755417

"Just got motivated to rave about this because I saw today in the Consumer Reports buying guide that the Cowon PMP got top recommendation.I returned a Creative Zen because it is too cumbersome to use and would duplicate files loaded on it, or lose them ... God knows why?  It also would not let me record FM from the device to the disk.The Cowon records FM radio, allows itself to be used as a hard disk. You can leave voice memos, listen to the FM radio, record radio. It is really nice and versatile.  It used many different formats ... I don't really use anything but MP3 at this time.I have a slight complain about it on the sound quality, it is good, but not perfect, but might be better with better headphones.  The Cowon should also come with some kind of case, and a little eyelet for hooking a lanyard to it for around the neck or something.  The mini joystick takes some getting used to ... but it is so much better than anything else I have seen, and 60GB is great ... I can put all my music on it and all my audio books which can be really compressed a lot.It is light and easy to use and it does not mess with your file data or the names ... a very understanding and helpful product when other companies seem to be about locking you into a certain system or making sure you do not share high quality files with anyone else.I give it a 5.

"I still have my TomTom700.  It had its quirks, but for the most part quite happy with it, except for when I was in an area on a highway and I needed to catch another ramp.  I was constantly trying to zoom out to make sure I was taking the right ramp.  Not easy to do on a 3.5 screen.  Here is what I've discovered so far.Pros:Lane Assist, major 5 star for me.  Here in S. CA, theirs one freeway after another, even without my glasses I can see it.Finding address, not bad.  I want to work with other addresses and check on this one further.Free traffic, so far this week traffic has been a breeze.  Go figure.One reason I went and purchased this was because of that feature.POI's with my glasses on I can see RiteAid, KFC, others no, I had this featured turned off on my TomTom.  Another item to research.  I can tell where their are item so I'm guessing that would be a good thing, especially if I need gas or want to stop for food.Screen, I can see the screen on a sunny day, with no shield required.  Auto night and Day function.  Works perfectly.  TomTom, I had to manually switch (700) model.I like that it doesn't have the MP3 player or video player.  I have an Ipod and Mini Disk, and find that would be a waste for me, nor do I want to pay for those items on a GPS unit.  Battery life even on the best of these is only around 5-8 hrs. My Mini Disk can play up to 50hrs.Once I played with the buttons, it sort of just relearning on a new Product.  I like it.  Once you get use to the touch sensitivity of it and how it responds, I don't have an issue.  It is different than the TomTom.  Letters are in alpha order not type writer order.Reroute, I can click on a road and have recalce the route.  Like TomTom, but I can select more than one road at the same time.Cons:I have to wear my glasses to read the small text.  I can see and hear directions.  Arrows are clear without glasses, but the unit has additional details that for me I need to wear my glasses.  I'm nearsighted, so that really isn't a big issue.  I keep a pair in the car.I keep my car in the garage, I haven't been able to set the address of where I want to go while in the garage, you can only do this when you have satellite connection outside, so I need to pull over of find a spot to pull over and wait.  In my area, finding such a spot isn't the easiest.  This is quirky, so I need to check the manual online this weekend and see if their are some options.The route to my home, once I'm on city streets is off.  Its the only one so far.  Others I've entered have been right on.  I'll be checking others this weekend.Overall, I'm impressed.  I was able to join my LG Dare to the unit, I saw where POI's have the phone numbers on the listing, so if the phone is attached I can call.  Another Item to get used to.  I don't have a data plan on my phone, nor do I want to have to pay for that with a GPS unit.  Something the others require you to have depending on the features you use.Can't wait to discover more with this unit.Oh, you don't need to order a separate screen protector, one comes with it in the box.  I may send the leather case back, I leave it on the bean bag I bought, and I just put the whole unit in my glove compartment, I'm able to close the door with the cable still attached.  I'm careful placing it in their, and the cable for the power seems sturdy.Hope this helps other users, I'll try and take some photos of what I was trying to explain.MOkay, I sent this item back, since I had the tomtom 700.  Well that ended up going blank a month latter.  I decided to go to a refurbished TomTom 730.  I like that I can select my POI's and turn them off individually.  The lane change on the Navigon, surpases the TomTom730.  You would be hard press to screw that up.  I live in Southern CA, one are of the 405 has 8 lanes at one point.  With Navigon, you will get the signs.  The Day light screen is brighter than the tomtom. 730.  TomTom, I can synch with the computer to update, when I get home, if I get myself into that mode of remembering.  the cradle is sitting right here looking at me.  Navigon?  I would suggest they add this.  navigon's holder is better than the tomtom 730.  Plan on buying a new holder, to attach to the windshield or weighted bag, if you go with the Tomtom 730.the refurbished TomTom 730 was less, than this.  At the time.  I purchased the Gas service from TomTom for $19.95.  thought what did I have to loose.  Well its not accurate, so don't waste your money.  Haven't tried the traffic FM.  Though here in CA, I was caught in traffic just this past Sat.Anyways for Knowing which freeway or lane, this is hands down the winner.  Try from Amizon, keep all of the packaging.  If they offer a cradle in the future, and options to change your POi's as you wish, then this would be my major go to.  I would put it at 3.5 stars at this point for this model.",2,2,0.001107205,0.0050433036,0.9938496

"I have had this case for a year now.  Have it running a mini itx atom 330 ion motherboard.  It is a tight fit, but I have a bluray drive in the DVD bay, 1.5 tb drive under it, a 1 tb drive on one side, and an SSD drive on the other side.  I run a small fan on top of the CPU/GPU that pushes more air right up into the powersupply and out the back.  My whole system uses so little power that the unit never even gets very hot.  Plenty of airflow.  Relatively quiet although mine is in an entertainment center.  I have it with 4gb of memory and a dual tuner in the pcix16 slot.

"The printer prints great from the included card reader.I found the prints from a computer to be too dark, i'll probably need to tweak the brightness control and be ok after that.It does not read xD cards natively, so you will need to either connect the camera to the usb port of the printer or use an xD to Compact Flash Adapter if your camera uses xD cards.The printer comes with a starter pack of 5 sheets andf enough ink for 5 pages.Buy the packs of 108 prints at amazon and save. price per page is about twice as much as costco but the convenience it great.What are we supposed to do with the film cassettes ? are they recyclable/ refillable ?

"See update at end of this posting.I purchased this unit, the Magellan RoadMate 3050T, which is the 3000T, but with the receiver for Traffic-enabled info. For what I paid for this unit and the features it has, I believe it to be a very good deal.The windshield suction cup mount works ok, but I wish it was a little stiffer. On bumpy roads the GPS can bounce up and down a little. With the unit mounted, the first time I tried to power it up I thought I got a bum unit. You have to hold the power on button for up to 15 seconds the first time, about 3 seconds after the first to have it spring to life. I think Magellan should state this right on the plastic protection sheet they have on the face of the unit. It would have saved me some startup anxiety.Once I got it working it zeroed in on the satellites very quickly. In the windshield mount, the gps maintains an excellent signal. In fact, much better then my Garmin Maps 76S. Even with heavy over cast and in tree cover I have full signal bars on the upper right of the display.Speaking display, this unit is very bright, even in full sun. In fact, at night, with the brightness turned all the way down, it is a little brighter then I really like.The display makes use of a lot of icons. I had to breakout the manual to figure what some of them meant.I am a stickler for wanting to know what direction I'm traveling. I planned to purchase the Garmin Streetpilot C550. I changed my mind after finding the Garmin does not display the normal compass heading on the main map display. The Magellan 3000T displays the heading full time in the map mode in the lower left corner. It uses the N, NE, E, SE, SW, W, NW headings.A very good sounding lady gives voice directions. It is very clear, and volume level is also very good. This unit does not have the ""text to speech"". However, after using the Magellan 3000T, I really don't care that it doesn't speak the road name. What it will do is tell you when a turn is coming up and which direction you will need to turn and on the display it gives you the name of the street. The directions are clear and understandable leaving no doubt what you need to do. The maps are from Navteq. I feel Navteq is the best out there.Update speed of this unit is very good. The display refreshes quickly and I never feel it is lagging behind. The route calculator waste no time as well. Most route calculations take less then 5 seconds to complete.With the TrafficKit, this gps can find you a way around most traffic flow issues like slowdowns, accidents, construction, and other reasons. Around the metro Detroit area it seems to work pretty well. However, on a trip up north, it didn't work as well. I believe this to be more of an issue with the service provider then a problem with the gps. I'm sure with time this will improve. One detour it took me on saved us over an hour in stop and go traffic with just a few miles added to the distance. For one year of service it cost about $60. I don't like how the TrafficKit attaches to the gps. The cables end up going all over the place and the antenna for the receiver is long. Seems they could have come up with a better design. I ended up leave the antenna lying on the dash. It just looks messy.The software that comes with the unit seems a little lame to me. You really can't do much with it. I wanted to be able to download the trip computer to my laptop. I have not found a way to do this. I'll be calling tech support to see if I'm missing something.I have not tried the mp3 player or picture functions as I really don't care to have pictures on the unit. I'll try the mp3 in the near future.For me, this unit is a keeper.Pros: Easy to see, easy to use once I learned the system, pleasant command voice, easy to remove and install into its mount,you have a choice of using the touch screen or navigation buttons.Cons: Power-on confusing the first time I used it, trafic receiver attachment messy, I had to upgrade the firmware to bring it up to date, it corrects early version lockups reported in some of the early reviews.(no big deal to update)Update as of 12-20-06Cons and Pro addition to date:  Can't use the MP3 player at the same time as navigating. POI database is wrong for southern Florida areas.  Items in the database not where the gps shows they are in the state of Florida. POI very good for Michigan.  All in all I still like this unit and find it as good or better then other brands in the same price range on the market.",2,2,0.086861104,0.19610181,0.7170371

"During my quest to find an inexpensive, not-loud 140mm fan, I stumbled upon this. At first I completely hated it because, like my last fan that it was replacing, it made a small rattling sound that drove me absolutely crazy. And no, the rattling did not come from my case as I tested the fan outside by itself to make sure. Now, I can easily stand the droning ""whurrrrr"" sound like most systems will always have, but NOT rattling. I didn't want to give up on it though because it does move a good deal of air and the price is right. During my fiddling around, I realized that the fan blade itself can be taken off to be cleaned and re-lubricated. You have to give it a good tug, but it does come off safely. Looking inside of the bearing, I noticed they didn't use a whole lot of grease on this thing, so I got some petroleum jelly and applied a generous amount inside of it. At first it didn't help out at all, but I left it running for a while and, viola, the rattling stopped!I am very happy with this fan now because it is relatively inexpensive, not loud by any means, and moves a good amount of air. It is much better than the Cooler Master R4 I also have in my case because the NZXT is only slightly louder, but moves A LOT more air than the R4, which will be getting replaced by another one of these NZXT's. I have, in total, 8 fans in my Thor V2 case (3 230mm, 3 140mm, 1 120mm, and the fan on my GPU).

"IF you don't like lifting heavy, put the wheels on this.  It's easily 30 lbs. just to haul this around your room.  I have a new found appreciation for tile floors because of that.  Otherwise, as for usability, this is probably the most amazing beginner tower ever.  You could add more fans and liquid cooling and it will still sound as if you don't have a computer sitting in your living room.I have purchased two of these for two builds, and I'm not regretting it.  They're not the most stylish of cases, but for what it's worth, they look pretty good sitting in my living room and bedroom.  One glows blue and green and the other glows a soft red (tribute to ASUS RoG mobo).  Superspeed USB 3.0 is a plus.  Plenty of room to work with.  You won't have a problem with just about anything!  Well, except the need to put thumbscrews in the hard drive bays.  I ended up using the back of my screwdriver as a hammer to tack in the screws.  Everything felt solid from start to finish.  I have no need for liquid cooling, so this case gets a 5 star review from me.By the way, CM, there's a bright beam of blue light that streaks across my bedroom onto the wall.  Please PLEASE stop using super bright 'laser' LED's for your hard drive lights...PROS:- Accessibility: Open and wide space.  The installation of an E-ATX motherboard will be extremely easy for you.

Out of the box this thing is under 28 lbs.  My rig is currently reaching 40 lbs. (last weighed at 38.2 lbs.).  Put your wheels on.  You'll love CM for that.  This is mostly in part due to the chassis being steel for that rugged ""military"" look.  By the way, I'm in the Navy, so that was a pretty cool touch.- Compatibility: Pretty much, what this comes down to is the customization.  Liquid cooling won't be a problem, but if you're going for aftermarket fans, you're going to want to stick to CM fans.  I have a twist tie keeping my wife's build for a 200mm NZXT green LED fan on her side panel.- Dirt: Okay, this is actually a minor problem as is since I'm ""Mr. Mom"" around the house, and I clean a lot anyways.  Every two weeks, I open my case and blow out or mini-vac the insides.  Takes no more than five minutes, but dust filters (like on the HAF X) would've been nice.  There are after market dust filters for this case, but they're way too expensive right now.My Cooler Master HAF 932A buildMotherboard:ASUS Maximus IV Extreme -Z - LGA 1155 - Z68 - Republic of Gamer Series - ATX Intel Z68 ATX DDR3 2200 MotherboardsCPU:Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core  LGA 1155 - BX80637I53570KRAM:Corsair Vengeance 8 GB ( 2 x 4 GB ) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) 240-Pin DDR3 Memory Kit for Intel Core i3, i5, i7 and AMD Platforms SDRAM CMZ8GX3M2A1600C9Graphics:MSI GeForce GTX560 Ti 1 GB DDR5 2DVI/Mini HDMI PCI-Express Video Card N560GTX TI TWIN FROZR II OCSound Card:Creative Sound Blaster Recon3D THX PCIE Fatal1ty Champion Sound Card SB1354SSD:Corsair Force Series GT 120 GB SATA 2.5-Inch SATA III Solid State Drive (CSSD-F120GBGT-BK)HDD:Western Digital Caviar Black 1 TB SATA III 7200 RPM 64 MB Cache Internal Desktop Hard Drive Bulk/OEM - WD1002FAEXPower Supply:OCZ Fatal1ty 750W Modular Gaming 80PLUS Bronze Power Supply compatible with Intel Sandy Bridge Core i3 i5 i7 and AMD Phenom",2,2,0.00037337313,0.0017318926,0.9978947

"[ UPDATE 4/20 ]  I now have four (4) lenses in this slingbag -- the new Pentax D-FA 100 f/2.8 Macro WR (inside of its lens bag) now goes in the corner where the fisheye was located, and the fisheye goes in the separate top compartment with the Pentax DA* 200 f/2.8's hood (instead of it, inside of its lens bag).  I actually have the Pentax DA* 16-50 f/2.8 on the camera with its hood inverted -- it all fits.  I have a pair of batteries in the front pouch, and it will clearly take a few more.Despite some of the other respondents, I fit a K20D (Pentax's largest/heaviest ever dSLR sans the new 645D medium format) with a DA* 16-50 f/2.8 on it (and its hood inverted), the DA* 200 f/2.8 next to it and the DA 10-17 Fisheye in the corner.  Yes, my f/2.8, 77mm lenses are fitting.  I do have to put the 200 hood in the top of the unit (instead of the main area), but everything fits, and well.  I'm so loving this bag.It is well-padded.  I don't know where other people get the idea it is not.  I originally bought the unit last fall, but didn't start using it until recently.  I normally only carry a holster and then lens bag, but this is so much better -- all-in-one (again, fish in top, macro in corner, tele alongside and camera+wide in main).It is crucial that one *LEARNS* how to wear and use it *PROPER*.  Otherwise, it is very confusing.  It's the SlingShot 300 and is just the right size for all the lenses I mentioned.  A K-x or K-7 would fit better than my K20D, and smaller lens sizes than my fast f/2.8, 77mm filter tele would likely fit the lens with the hood still attached (inverted).Highly recommend this sling bag, especially if you can get it for $20 like I did.",2,2,0.0058387383,0.011476689,0.98268455

"I bought the drive to burn HD video from a Sony camera with PowerDirector Ultra 10.  It worked out of the box, which is all I want from a drive, and the physical installation (replacing another driver) only required  removing one screw holding the other drive in place.  The installation CD came with a lot of CyberLink software.  I started burning a pre-made movie project about 15 minutes after opening the case to start the drive swap.  The were only two hitches.  One was with with Power Director - must go to Create Disc/2D Disc/Blu Ray to choose the burn format, at which time a pop-up asks to initialize the blue ray drive.  I don't know why PowerDirector requires this step - it is probably to initialize a CyberLink program needed to burn, but it should be automatic when the proper drive is chosen and not an additional step.  This is not a drive problem in my opinion.  The second hitch is that the drive door is wider than the width of the prior drive, so it did not open/close due to the plastic casing my computer has around the drive bays.  I enlarged the casing opening slightly and that solved the problem.",2,2,0.02388971,0.09115371,0.8849566

"In short, this may have been my best investment as an amateur photographer and filmmaker. This lovely bit of glass captures great color, and the wide aperture works wonders in low-light situations. The range of its focal length gives me plenty of options when shooting without having to swap out lenses (something I hate to do when I'm just out for a leisurely stroll and shoot), and the focus ring has a lot of travel, allowing for much easier focusing than lower-end lenses.The weight of this thing is its gift, and its curse. It feels solid and sturdy enough to take a mortar shell, which is comforting. On the other hand, when snapped onto an equally hefty body, such as my 6D, it becomes a challenge to lug around without a nice strap. It also presents balancing issues when placed on any cheap steadicam; a common sight on amateur film shoots.If you're looking to step up your gear, I would highly suggest starting with some nice glass like this.",2,2,0.0047494755,0.043023035,0.9522275
"This is a nicely made flash drive with plenty of room for lots of big files.  And, it is a good value for the money compared to other 16 GB flash drives.  Also, I like the retractable USB connector - it slides in and out easily via a little tab on the side.  And, once extracted, a little indent clicks in so that the connector will not be forced into the drive when the drive is inserted into a USB port.On the negative side, it doesn't have an LED indicating read/write access.  This is a minor issue to me, but thought it deserved mention.  Another con, however, might be a bit more of an issue for some people.  This flash drive is a bit slow compared to two others I have.  I ran some simple benchmarks, copying files to this drive as well as two others:  a 2 GB ""no name"" flash drive (drive ""A"" in the results below) I got for free at a computer store as a promo about a year ago, and a Lexar 256 MB drive (drive ""B"" below) that is a least two years old.  I copied two sets of files as detailed below & timed the results with a stop watch.  No other folders / files were on the drives when I copied the files.  I conducted the tests twice on each drive - the times given are an average.  (I did not conduct any read tests, just these write tests).File set ""1"":  2 folders, 1 containing 192 files / 20 MB, the other 72 files / 8.63 MBFile set ""2"":  1 folder, containing 23 sub-folders w/ 495 files / 31.7 MBAnd, the test results:Drive ""A"" (No Name, 2 GB)File set ""1"":  18 sec.File set ""2"":  27 sec.Drive ""B"" (Lexar, 256 MB)File set ""1"":  26 sec.File set ""2"":  50 sec.This Kingston 16 GB driveFile set ""1"":  30 sec.File set ""2"":  75 sec.As the results of this admittedly fairly unscientific test show, this drive was the slowest of the bunch - almost twice as slow as the 2 GB drive for file set ""1"", and over twice as slow as the 256 MB drive on file set""2"".So, if speed is an issue for you, you may want to look elsewhere (and perhaps spend more money as a result).

"You may have noticed that a lot of vandal dome style cameras look the same, that's because for the most part some of them are the same.  I have taken a few like models that were branded differently apart to find that the boards and ID numbers matched in several instances even when having paid up to $30 in price difference, this means they were made by one manufacturer and massively branded.

"I've had this now for almost two years, and while Logitech had to replace it with a new one (and it was a brand new unit, not a refurb), that doesn't lessen my favorable review.I use this for my Media Center PC, in addition to a Logitech Harmony One remote.  I also have the Mac thin bluetooth keyboard and trackpad for when I need to do ""real"" typing since this really isn't a good way to do normal typing.My Harmony One is what I use mostly for the day to day work, but I don't like the phone style letters, for example when I'm trying to jump in my movie list.  So for that I pull out the Dinovo Mini so I can actually type the name.  I also use this for when I'm redoing the media center recorded shows, to convert them to an MP4 format to save space for my 7 year old's cartoons, to copy and paste the show titles from the descriptions into the file name for when I file them into the appropriate folders.The construction is surprisingly well done, and a striking appearance.  So small it fits easily anywhere, and the battery really does last a month between charges.  Hinge is easy to open, and the buttons have a great positive tactile click so you know when one is depressed.  I almost never have any failed input with them.The touchpad works great, but you may want to increase the movement rate so that you don't have to slide your thumb over and over and over to get it to move across the screen.  Even at about a 18 to 20 foot distance, with the receiver plugged into the back of my mac mini that I use to run Windows 7 Media center, behind everything in the cabinet, the signal is great.Makes it so nice to be able to minimize my media center window, hop into internet explorer, and check my mail and such, or to jump into Explorer and look for that file I wanted that's on my home server.There are only three programmable buttons for actions you can set yourself (I set mine to close program, open IE to my mail, and restart system), and one thing I found with the newer revision is that what used to be the green media center hot button in the bottom right is no longer media center, and cannot be changed, it just opens up media player... I assume that is because more people use it for things other than media center, so they didn't want to lock it to one particular less popular app...  But it would have been nice if we could've changed that when desired.It can also be used for the PS3 but I haven't tied it into mine at all as I really have no use for a keyboard on my PS3.Every month or so I plug it in overnight to the charger, and I'm set for quite a long stretch of use.My original had to be replaced about the 11 month mark because the mouse button no longer was working.  Logitech was very good about the return, and I had a new one within a few days, no problems and no charge.  This one has now gone for that long and a little more, and the button still works fine.I did get the bluetooth mac keyboard and touchpad for when I want to do real computer things on here, but those are too large and impractical for just media use.  And while this works well for media center or HTPC use, it's still not as practical as a full fledged remote due to the lack of programmability, but while it may not be my main input device for my normal viewing, it is essential for the times when I need to put down the remote and use a mouse.  I've had many other keyboards I used before this, including the microsoft media center one that uses the IR conector, but none have been as convenient and easy to use as this for those times.Well worth the price.",2,2,0.0014699942,0.014582396,0.98394763

"I ordered a few Belkin covers to complement my new iPad mini. This was my favorite cover ... by far.

(Contrast stitching would have been ""too busy,"" so this was a fine choice).-Spectacular quilting design.Function:-Said quilting design also functions as a means of padding. Those squishy little diamonds assist to protect the iPad. Nice!-Micro-fiber interior easily protects one's iPad from any potential scratches.-The case is just a touch harder to fold than others (as a result of the padding), but I think this is an acceptable trade-off since I would rather have a bit more padding and protection for my investment.-The snap-in design firmly holds my iPad in place ... even after dashing across campus to the library.

"This is not a comprehensive review-just a review of what features I personally use in this HDTV as of this writing (January 2009).  I just wanted to post my support for Sony making a very nice LCD-based HDTV.I'm not a high end video enthusiast, and I bought the unit on sale ($1700), as I thought the launch price of $2500 was WAY too much.  Anyway, I mostly use it with my Playstation 3 games and Blu-Ray movies, and may use it for PC gaming later.  The images are nice and crisp and the anti-judder ""motionflow"" is creepy, but cool.  Watching Rambo 4 panning sequences makes it look like actual live action, so for movies that are shot natively at 24 FPS, the technology has a ""wow factor"" that has to be seen to be believed.  Wipeout HD looks fantastic on it, and seeing Blu-Ray resolution images on something of this size (or bigger) is a noticeable step up in visual quality that standard DVD resolutions just don't have even if they are upscaled.  I plugged in my wife's laptop and with a gold-plated VGA connector, the 1280X1024 resolution was good, but her laptop doesn't offer a 1920X1080 resolution so if you have the intent to use the HDTV as a giant computer monitor, check to make sure your video card has the option of 1920X1080.  The unit includes some JPEG images hardwired to the Linux-powered BRAVIA system, and so the colors are really robust on a high quality still picture.  The navigation menus are pretty easy to use including the network setup.  The audio has a good volume to it, and there is just enough bass to balance everything out.  The simulated surround sound also works nicely.  The unit feels like it is under 50 pounds so it's easily movable and the chassis is very attractive (I like the ""floating LED"" on the front).So far the only negative here is that the remote control cannot control my Playstation 3 Blu-Ray DVD functionality.  I assumed that it would...If you can get this HDTV under $2000, like the price I paid for it, it's still expensive, but I think it's worth it.Update: While the product is excellent more than 2 years later, I was made aware of Sony's hostile attitude to people tinkering with their stuff, such as the way Sony completely overreacted to the hacker GeoHot jailbreaking the Playstation 3.  Apparently Sony was also involved with some kind of rootkit fiasco several years ago and before that they sued a Playstation 1 emulator out of existence (called BLEEM), so this will be the last Sony product I buy for a long time until they change their attitude about reverse engineering their products.  Samsung happens to make some excellent displays from what I have recently seen...",2,2,0.18674707,0.35122454,0.4620284

"I&#8217;ve been using this remote for about 6 weeks now.  The main reason I got it was because my TV and components are on adjacent walls, and there is not always a direct line of sight to the components.  My original plan was to get an IR repeater and just use all my OE remotes, but a friend suggested this instead.  It cost about $30 more than the repeater I was looking at, but well worth it.  I programmed / taught this remote, and put all the other remotes in a drawer.  This is the only remote I need now.  The RF capability allows me to use the remote from anywhere in the house and so far has worked without any problems.  The range of both the remote itself and the RF blaster are very impressive.  Much better than the original remotes.  For example, I have the RF blaster in the component cabinet with a glass door.  But the blaster still controls my TV on the adjacent wall.  After playing around with this remote for a bit, here&#8217;s the tips I&#8217;d suggest&#8230;1)  Use pre-programming first&#8230;but try SEVERAL of the codes.  Using the pre-program method will take care of most of the basics (volume, numbers, etc&#8230;).  But don&#8217;t just stick with the first code that &#8220;works&#8221; for your component.  Try them all, and then look at all the pages in the LCD.  I found a few nice functions that the OE remotes did not have.  For my Samsung TV, the RF20 had commands for discrete on/off, and shortcuts to functions (&#8230;sleep timer, PIP) that the OE remote did not have.  The discrete on/off was key to the macros that I programmed.  It also had some discrete input selections for my TV which were also important to the macros.  From that point, use the learning function to teach the RF20 anything that was missed from the OE remote.  And use the buttons where you can in place of the LCD.2) Write it out first.  I found it helpful to map out where I wanted the functions of the OE remote to be on the RF20&#8230;especially for the LCD.  You can group functions on the LCD in a way that is logical to you, put the most used functions on Pg 1, etc...I also found it helpful to have macros written out first.  That way if something doesn&#8217;t work as intended and you need to make a tweak (like add a longer pause), it&#8217;s very easy to see what you did and make the corrections very quickly.3) Use &#8220;Press-and-Hold&#8221; macros.  I have all my component buttons also set up with press and hold macros.  If I want to watch cable TV, I press and hold the &#8220;Cable&#8221; component button which runs a macro that turns on the components I need, turns off the components I don&#8217;t, and sets the TV to the right input.  I also have a press and hold macro set up to the Off button that turns off all the components in my system (but I&#8217;m still able to turn Off components discretely if I need to by switching to that component and simply pressing the Off button).4) If you have discrete on/off for all of your components, be sure to include ALL components in your power macros.  Program the macro to turn On what you need&#8230;but be sure to send the signal to turn Off what you don&#8217;t (if the component is already off&#8230;it won&#8217;t do anything).  Doing the macros this way will allow you to easily &#8220;switch&#8221; between your components.  So if I&#8217;m watching cable, and then want to watch a DVD, I press and hold the DVD component button which turns on the player and audio receiver, sets the TV to the right input, but also turns off the cable box (and any other component that might be on). Again, this only works if you have discrete on/off functions.Some reviewers have complained that this remote is difficult to program.  I did not find it to be a problem at all.  Just need to follow the directions.Also the remote I got was not dark gray as shown in the picture.  Mine is silver, and the cursor button (the round ring) looks like chrome plating.  I actually like it better than what's shown in the picture.",2,2,0.00058337254,0.0022959823,0.9971206

"Just got this installed over the weekend (July 12, 2014)  It's very nice cable; feels very sturdy and well constructed, the connectors also held together great when being worked through a 3/4&#34; hole in my batt insulated exterior walls.  At the moment we've only got 200mbps connection (1g by 2015) but we got it installed and had 201mbps despite the 200' so it looks great.  Just as a note, this cable has some stiffness to it so watch for kinks when unrolling it.Also I've done an exterior mount instead of burying it so we'll see how that goes.  I installed it with these 7mm cable clips ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I98Z1Y/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 ) which are just the right size and hammered easily into standard R11 siding.

"It works flawlessly the first time you connect and it never heats up. I'm not always a big fan of Netgear but this product is very good.

"I purchased this product for my Asus U36JC-B1 which is the super slim notebook offering from Asus.  The speed on this laptop is already very good, but I know with the 500gb SATA at the heart of it, slow down would be inevitable.  So after purchasing the Crucial C300 for my HP DV7-2040us I decided to pick up this newer model for my Asus.  I cloned my original 500GB SATA drive to this using Acronis True Image 2009 and a external USB 2.5"" case.  Acronis adjusted the partitions so everything fitted perfectly, including the recovery partition which are critical on these drives considering there is no optical drive.I also made sure all setting were adjusted in Windows 7 64bit to account for the new drive, including disabling defrag and indexing, enabling TRIM, and if need be disabling LPM in the registry.  Make sure you download the latest Intel Rapid Storage Driver, this can have a dramatic impact on speeds and how the drive is handled by Windows.Intel Rapid Storage Driver: [...]I am not disappointed with this hard drive, here's why:Boot times are much quicker,Application response is very quick,No unreliability issues (thus far),Battery life appears to have improved,Switching from steel to plastic makes it slightly lighter,Easy to install, remove your old SATA drive and plug this one in, easy!,Installing one of these is like having a new laptop (in my opinion) the speed increase is dramatic, over and above a CPU upgrade.I'm not trying to be a poster boy for Crucial but I am so impressed with these drives, I purchased another 2!  1x 128gb and 1x 64gb M4.  I have a total of 4 Crucial drives running in different computers.I highly recommend this product.",2,2,0.006893181,0.015934708,0.9771721

"I have had cheapo tripods-but I never used them after one or two tries. It was too hard to change orientation etc. I bought this along with the Manfrotto 190XPROB tripod. I tried to find some reviews on tripods and very quickly learned that they were expensive. Ouch! I am an amateur so that ruled out carbon fiber tripods as way too expensive. I also quickly learned that you had to buy the head and tripod separately for the good ones. Never expected that the head would be as expensive as the tripod! I was still not sure what to get and so I decided that I would take a chance and buy them  based on recommendations made in a digital photo book that I liked:The Digital Photography BookJoystick head:Pros: If you have never used a joystick head on a tripod, this will come as a pleasant surprise! I was a little nervous since I was not sure what to expect-I had only read reviews on it. But it was what I expected: It was very quick and easy to use. Speed was my biggest hangup with other tripods. I really didnt want to have to fiddle with knobs and things umpteen times to get the camera at the right angle prior to working on focus and other important things. With this joystick, you only need one hand to move the camera around at various angles.

It doesn't register on my Kill-a-Watt except when it is first connected.Another indication of -wasted power- is HEAT.  If a device is HOT it is wasting power by turning it into heat.This router is COOL to the touch ...  meaning there is -no wasted power-!My ADSL / router ( Comtrend ADSL/2 CTZ-5621T )is HOT to the touch and consumes a few watts. (probably wasted in inefficient circuitry )I am going to look at D-Link to see if they have something for a more efficient replacement.",2,1,0.30284613,0.6491072,0.048046626
"I bought this product (Sansa E260) simply to have a little more memory than my original SanDisk player, which is only a 256MB player - but still in great working order.  After a lot of researching, I settled on the E260 - even though it was older than the FUZE, Clip, and other models.  The replaceable battery was a big seller for me - as I didn't want to have it die after a year & then have to buy a whole new player.I love the extra memory, as now I can download radio podcasts (2 - 3 hrs of content) and listen to them at my leisure, without having to discard some music to make space.The possibility of playlists was also interesting me, as I also use the unit for learning songs that my band is playing, so want to group them together for easy access.  Also, being a magician, I was looking for a way to group the music for my act in one place and then play it from there.  An MP3 player allows for the easy changing of a show, simply by altering the playlist, rather than burning a new CD each time.Here is where the problem comes in:The player will not allow me to create playlists (at least, not in the manner that I expected).  Sure, it will add the music to the player, but won't keep a folder/file called ""Band Music"" (for example) that would contain that music in order to access the 5 songs I need, rather than all 200 on the player.  As you can see, for a magic show, this would obviously not work.There are work-arounds, but will be a bit of a hassle if I have to do it on a regular basis.ALSO - It seems that the player only allows two ways to decide the order of my music - either in ""Shuffle Play"", or by ""Artist"".  So - even if I play by grouping of Genre, when playing from the ""Country"" folder - it wants to play all of the Kenny Chesney songs, before moving on to any of the Brad Paisley songs (for example) - again, unless I want to ""Shuffle"" (which, by the way, resets the order every time you shut the player off - so you have the potential to hear the same 3 songs - in the same order - multiple times in a row - yes, it's already happened).  There should be a way to play a random mix of the songs in the ""Country"" folder - perhaps like in alphabetical order of the title (like my old player did).So - overall:Do I like it?  Yes - despite my complaining, I do like it quite a bit.  The controls are wonderful, after you figure them out.Is it better than my old 256 MB player?  Not even close (except for the memory).However, I realize that if I weren't set in my ways - I would absolutely love this player (except for the Playlist issue) - so yeah, go ahead and buy one!-------------------------Okay - here is an update on this player - by using Rhapsody, it will allow you to create playlists - I was using Windows Media Player before.  Rhapsody will allow you to do this by downloading their software, but you do NOT need to purchase their service as long as you are only going to load your own music.  Now, it seems, my playlist issue should be a non-factor.  Hooray!!--------------------------Another update (Feb-13-09): When using Rhapsody playlists, my player will FREEZE.  So, now I am avoiding using playlists of any sort and am doing a home-made work around.  Yes, it's cumbersome, but better than nothing!--------------------------Yet another update (May-24-2012):  I am still using this player.  I love my player.  Battery still going strong, easy loading, navigating.  They appear to still be for sale.  If this one dies, I will consider buying another rather than a more expensive player.  I am so very happy with this purchase.",2,2,0.0007969629,0.0033900784,0.99581283

I recommend this drive.This is the single best performance upgrade for most desktop or laptop pc's.Update 03/11/2014:  I have now purchased several more of these, most recently two 120GB units and one 240GB unit.

I have some expertise in the area of computer performance, and for home use, these are fine.  System boots and application launches are lightning fast.  I don't care what the benchmarks are.

The thing really works well on the plane, stays discrete.For performance - hardly any hiccups, I've had a few glitches and reboots required, but no more than my others.Maybe my favorite thing is the swipe to type - it work's very well.  I can go about as fast as I want and it usually picks the right word, and it has changed my idea of the tablet handicap for composing text.The most functional, value added part of this gem is the built in true GPS.  I'll confirm that it works just fine, with no wifi.  I took it across the US and across the UK and found the GPS never had an issue getting a signal.

"I've had these headphones for years. I see they haven't come down in price really, but they've lasted longer than every other headphone set I've had and I use them all the time for biking and running. Something like 2006 I got mine and this is 2011.So things I like, easy, durable short cord. I have an arm band around my mp3 player on my upper left arm and it mostly just stays out of the way.How they're different... they have nubs that come off the ear cup and just sit in your ear. They keep it in place so a tug on the cord doesn't pull the phones off your head.The cords are thin, which bugged me when I first got them, but these have kept hold and never gotten loose or had static at all. I'm amazed actually. I hope that everyone gets as good a pair as mine, I hope they are just constructed great because if mine do go out, I'm going to get them again.The cord placement off the left middle might seem odd, but actually it makes sense, again not pulling the phones off (like rear placement would) and not coming off the earcups, which would probably lessen the life of the cable and pull it too easily from the source.Last thing, one tip I have for using any headphones. I keep a really small binder clip attached to the cord and clip the cable to my shirt so it stays flush with it. That way it doesn't loop around my bike or tree branch or flip around during my stride.",2,2,0.0004378305,0.004537885,0.99502426
"I am thrilled at how well this antenna works. I was planning to install it outside of my home, but I wasn't able to find a location that was hidden from street view, so before tearing holes into the side of my house, I decided to give the attic a shot.  It installed easily to a rafter in the attic and I hooked it up to the tv, hoping for a few decent stations. To my surprise, my television recognized a very strong signal and located nearly 60 stations! The weather was overcast and rainy, but all the stations signals were strong.The HD stations are absolutely, crystal clear, better than what I was receiving from the cable company.

Yes it will work with the IMAC.  Does not work very well but it will work on  an IMAC.  The keyboard constantly goes to sleep and has to be awoken on a regular basis.  The purpose of this is to enhance battery life the result of which is to cause problems for the user.  Keyboard has a tendency to drop keystrokes causing frustration for touch typists who have to constantly review what they are typing.  Have been online with technical support and was told there is no way to disable the sleep feature.  A shame really because in every other way this is a fantastic product.  Quality is high and the price is right.  Did not realize how much I would miss the escape key until I did not have it.  I finally got tired of re-pairing and had to go back to USB keyboard.Update: In case you wonder if your reviews matter. Just received a call from the company that makes this keyboard. They are sending us a new one to review. It will not have the escape key but it supposedly does not have to be woken up so often. Once we get it and test it will once again up date this review. We are impressed. Not many companies we know go this distance to make a customer satisfied. Stay tuned!,2,2,0.07371769,0.24623773,0.68004453
"I recently bought a pair of these Bushnell PowerView 12X50 Binoculars and have been quite happy with them. The quality is good and the price from Amazon was great. The feel of them is good, not to light and not to heavy. I like the 12X50 fixed power and they focus very well with the ""InstaFocus""lever. Looking through them I get a very clear bright view of what ever I'm looking at and the 12 power brings in what ever I'm looking at nice and close. I had another pair of zoom binoculars that were 12X60X70 but they proved to be much too big and powerful for my needs so I sold them and got these and I would defiantly recommend them if your looking for a good general pair of binoculars. Bushnell has been around for a long time and they give a lifetime warranty. It also came with a with a good storage case and although some have reported that the included strap is poor I don't agree and I find it is heavy enough to serve it's purpose of hanging it around your neck.

"When I first purchased Altec Lansing inMotion speakers for my iPod near a couple years ago, I immediately fell in love with them. They were the kind of things you took in public and people would say ""That's coming from those little speakers!?!"" While treasuring them on every road trip and day outdoors, I had one question in my mind: ""When is a product going to top this one?"" Although all kinds of iPod speakers followed in their footsteps, this is the first time one in the same league has topped the inMotion speakers.Yes.. In my opinion, these are the best travel speakers you could possibly buy for the iPod. Below I will review why these are the best choice over Altec Lansing's inMotion speakers, JBL's OnStage speakers, and larger systems such as the Bose SoundDock. I will also review the pros and cons of the mm50s as a stand-alone product.Why buy these over JBL OnStage speakers? - These not only sound better, but can be played without plugging into an electric outlet. The OnStage set is popular because they look cool and sound good. When such a compact system has no option to run off batteries, the size seems to be in vain.Why buy these over the Bose SoundDock? - The sound quality is near the same league of that produced by the SoundDock while selling for a fraction of the cost. The Bose SoundDock is essentially not even a travel system because you need to plug it in an outlet whenever you use it. Beyond that it is really too large to comfortably fit in any kind of suit case while leaving room for anything beyond a single pair of socks. The Logitech MM50s are convenient for packing with your luggage and could be played for 7 or more hours at a time without needing a plug.Why buy these over larger boom-box style systems?  - With sound quality touching near the same goal post as those that require their own duffle bag, there is no question about it if you plan on using your speakers for travel... And isn't that the point of getting a one-piece unit over a regular stereo or 2.1 system? The MM50s are small enough to stuff in a suitcase without sacrificing much space yet unpack with the power to rock out a good-sized room.Most important ...Why these over the Altec Lansing inMotion speakers? - Altec Lansing's inMotion speakers really remained the king of the travel-sized iPod speakers since they were released. It doesn't matter if they had the travel remote or how they folded up. They continue to be compact, sound great for the size, and charge up the iPod when you plug them in the wall. Since the release of the mm50s, they are no longer the best in their league, however. This comes at a single cost.Unlike the 8 inch wide inMotion speakers, the mm50s stretch near 13 inches in width. The actual body is slightly thicker as well, but remains shorter in height. Add it all up and the mm50 is slightly larger in overall mass. After selling my inMotions before receiving my mm50s, I wondered if I made the correct decision in upgrading due to the size difference. Now I can comfortably say the larger body is definitely worth it. In most cases, the mm50s can pack in your luggage just as easily as the inMotions.The physical size difference is more than paid for in sound quality, which is considerably better in terms of bass and presence. The surround feature also adds a touch of depth to certain songs that cannot be matched by the inMotion speakers by any means. Beyond that, they could actually pump out bass, something the inMotion speakers could never do regardless of the sound depth they produced. This is not thumping bass, yet a significant improvement resulting from the larger drivers. They are no louder in volume than the inMotions, however.The mm50s top inMotion, yet they are still far from being a perfect travel system. From a physical standpoint, the speakers are solid and perfectly match the design of the iPod. They actually feel more like a brick than the inMotion speakers, which are a bit on the flimsy side in comparison. The buttons on the speakers and the remote are solid as well, which really make the system friendly to the wear and tear of travel. The grill in front of the drivers is also more than enough to protect them.The sound quality, while exceeding that of the inMotion speakers can still distort at high levels, but this greatly depends on the kind of music being played. I was surprisingly able to play Daft Punk with the bass pumping yet hardly any distortion.The remote does a fine job at flipping between songs, pausing, and adjusting the volume. It even lets you skip forward and backward through slide shows. Being that this functionality was included, it is surprising that there is no AV out cable hook-ups on the back of the unit for TV use. This could have easily saved the need to buy a $20 AV cable for the video iPod, but is by no means a deal breaker.The three most significant kinks in the operation of the mm50s lie in the remote, volume controls, and internal battery. The remote is the least forgiving of these, because it seems like something that could have easily been avoided. As stated in other reviews, the remote only works when it is pointed in a relatively straight direction toward the sensor on the speakers. Pointing the controller any higher or lower will simply not work. This appears to be due to the fact that the sensor is sunken so deep into the speaker unit itself, a mistake which shows a major lack of consideration in design. Another kink lies in the fact that the volume controls on the speakers effect the setting on the iPod itself, but changing the volume on the iPod does not effect the volume of the speakers. This can result in the iPod displaying low volume while the speakers themselves are cranked to the max. This is a small detail, but remains a confusing aspect I believe could have been avoided.The internal rechargeable battery, while sparing the expense of disposable ones, leaves no easy option for replacement. This greatly limits the possibility for extended cordless use beyond 7 or so hours. The option to swap rechargeable batteries would have added enough flexibility to comfortably use the speakers over camping trips, but was sadly left out from the design, causing the battery to be a trade-off instead of a gain (Inexcusable, Logitech).Other reviews have noted how the flip out legs do not work on uneven surfaces, but this is something that can be remedied with a little imagination and leg adjustments. The speakers also have the tendency to move while playing at high volumes. This is another thing that could be remedied with a bit of imagination. Neither of these I would consider to be design flaws simply because they are a direct result of the decision to make the speakers as compact as possible.As I have listed all the flaws of these speakers, the mm50s are still the nearest you can get to a perfect travel speaker set for the iPod. The flaws of this product are more aggravating in the sense that they could have been avoided than in actual use. Any iPod is really incomplete without them.",2,2,0.0012180161,0.0018810829,0.9969009

"Someone taught me a long time ago that when asked ""How good is that product/tool/item""? The correct answer is almost always ""it depends on who you are and what you are up to"". For video/photography gear, I find this answer to be appropriate no matter what gear is being discussed.In the case of this tripod, I absolutely love it for several reasons. My usage is typically shooting video of sporting events from a press box or bleachers or other high vantage point. Or a wander off in the woods or a park to take photos. Or travelling via airplane. In any case I need to carry my gear a fair amount, so compactness and weight are important factors for me. Over recent years I have searched and tried to replace heavier items with lighter items, all else being equal. I no longer feel an eight pound ballhead and six pound tripod fit my typical needs. My current needs put a premium on well-built, light products, and this tripod is a definite standout in that area.1) I have what I consider a ""stationary"" tripod/ballhead setup (quite heavy, where weight, i.e., stability can be a good thing), but for the most part my tripods do not sit in a studio or office, and do not sit on a set of wheels. They are bagged and carried.2) This tripod is wonderfully light (two+ pounds). If I have to lug something around, it is a joy to shed 2-3 pounds from its closest rival in my tripod collection.3) It is COMPACT (even with my largish Manfrotto video head attached).4) It is rock steady in all outdoor conditions in which I would use a tripod (I don't shoot in hurricanes, but you certainly might).5) Its minimum working height with ""reasonable"" leg splay is a huge bonus for me. With a ""desk-width"" footprint, this tripod is about 6-8"" shorter than other similarly robust tripods I own.6) Accessories such as the center column, landscape panning head and the leveling bowl are reasonably priced.7) IMO the designers did a great job, from the light weight/usable height, the ""legs fold upside down"" trick to make it even more compact for traveling, to the hook attachment in the center column accessory being very versatile (just the hook screws off leaving stud, entire hook assembly screws off and inside has 1/4"" nut, etc.).When I use this in a press box (shooting through an open window for instance), the tripod typically has to sit on a desk or shelf surface just inside the window. This invariably requires a small usable footprint along with a short working height (with video head and shotgun mic) in order to fit in the window, which is NOT an easy thing to pull off for a robust tripod. The Feisol is a perfect fit for this use.When shooting video ""in the open"" with a video head, this has more than enough height for me to comfortably stand and shoot (I'm 5'11"") using no center column. Leg locks work fine, are quick and show no slippage.This tripod is not cheap in the big scheme of things, so it is likely not for everyone. Compared to other tripod systems I own, IMO the price is not outlandish. But this has become my ""go to"" tripod, so for me the price was well worth it.",2,2,0.0008241962,0.0059923134,0.99318355
"First, much thanks to ""Jerry Van De Beek"" for the following tip! That is, to ""convert the 3TB HDD (Hard-Disc-Drive) to a GPT disk in Disk management"" was very helpful. However, I wanted to make a client's 3TB into an external drive to replace an older similar version in 1TB. After experimenting for a while, I figured it out. First, your GPT tip got me started as I was able to convert from ""Dynamic Disc"" / ""MBR Disc"" to ""GPT Disc,"" which allowed me to merge the drive into a single large 2.72TB after formatting as opposed to two or three smaller hard-drives (Dynamic/MBR mode). I then had to allocate and create a ""Primary Disc Drive"" with all options to format or assign a drive letter UNCHECKED (Important step). After doing this via a [Vantec CB-ISATAU2 SATA/IDE to USB 2.0 Adapter Supports 2.5-Inch, 3.5-Inch, 5.25-Inch Hard Disk Drives (Black) by Vantec; ""you may find this awesome device on Amazon as indicated above, which lets you connect virtually any type of hard-disc-drive or CD-ROM/DVD/Blue-Ray drive externally to any computer/laptop via a basic USB/SATA connector etc...great in the case of mounting/unmounting/restoring crashed computer/laptop systems as you are granted instant access to any Primary or Logical drives as though it were a basic data drive""]. Next, after creating an identifiable ""healthy primary partition,"" I unplugged the 3TB HDD from the Vantec adapter and proceeded to connect to an external fan-less aluminum self-cooling casing. Voila!! There it was, finally, the external casing could identify the full 3TB (2.72TB formatted) HDD and all is well...now backing-up/restoring a client's HDD (moving all 1TB' worth of data to the newer 3TB, which could take days or weeks to complete...who knows for sure?).",2,2,0.04095608,0.059738714,0.8993053

"My previous headset was the Plantronics foldable, it was light and easy to carry around.  It lasted for two years then I had to shop around for another.  My first instinct was to be guided by the reviews.  I was drawn to this one because I didn't have to be tethered to my PC while I skype out.The call quality is good, both parties hear each other quite clearly and the battery life goes for five solid hours.  However, I gave this four stars because I found the headset a bit heavy for me and the forty foot range that is purported assumes there are no thick walls nor obstructions in your path.  It does give a beep and indicate that you are getting out of range, which is a plus.  I would have preferred the USB receiver to be smaller.  The size is cumbersome and could easily become dislodged if you have other bits of equipment around.These are my personal little peeves and not necessarily deal breakers. I would recommend purchase.",2,2,0.006359915,0.13266873,0.86097133

I purchased this camera to replace an LNC 104.  The reason that I replaced the other camera was that it did not have or you did not have the ability to communicate without adding external speakers to the camera...which was more of a pain than anything.  This camera is a little bit different then the 104 as far as setup is concerned.  With this camera you simply scan the QR code that comes up on your laptop or cell phone the camera reads it and you are connected to your wifi in just a few simple steps.  Now here is what drove me nuts.  Unless I was in a room where bright light was flashing directly into the lens of the camera the picture on my cell was in black and white.  With the LNC 10 4 I did not have any problem like this.  If the room was dim it would still show up in color if it was dark then it would be black and white. I finally figured out that you had to go into settings and go under the video and then you had to change the camera setting for night mode from automatic to manua. I just put it on manual daylight. That seem to clear up the issue of the camera showing in black and white all time. I seem to have a little bit of an issue with the microphone not connecting so far it seems to be working again and I will have to get back to you to comment if it keeps working or not. I will say that the video quality of the LNC 204 is much superior to the LNC 10 4. I can zoom in on whatever I am looking at and it comes in clear with the LNC 10 it would pixelate.  So for right now I will say that I'm very happy with the camera once I figured out the little glitches the picture is great and I have had these cameras before so I would not have purchased another one if I did not like them.,2,2,0.032963064,0.091073774,0.8759631

"I can't say much here that others here haven't said already, but I can address the one question that I was wondering about before buying: Will the Modi/Magni stack make my headphones sound better than they currently sound plugged into my computer?I was using 2 main sets of headphones plugged directly into the rear headphone port of a Creative Sound Blaster Z: HiFiMan HE-400 and Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro (80 ohm).  Both sounded very, very good to me, and the Sound Blaster Z description page says it can drive headphones spec'd up to 600 ohm, so I wondered whether an inexpensive USB DAC and amp like the Modi and Magni ($100 each) would be a noticeable improvement from this sound card.The answer to that question is ""Yes!""  Both of the aforementioned headphones stepped up dramatically with the new DAC/amp.  The bass on Ron Carter's ""My Funny Valentine"" is tighter and more natural than before.  I didn't hear any buzz or noise with the Sound Blaster Z, but the overall clarity of the music is far greater with the Modi/Magni.  I feel like my $200 headphones now sound like $300 headphones, and my $300 now sound like $500 headphones :).  Even my low impedance V-MODA M-80 headphones sound better through this stack.If you are looking for better headphone music audio quality that beats the Schiit out of what you get from plugging into your computer, you are currently using motherboard audio or the equivalent of a Sound Blaster Z, and you do not need the surround sound / gaming features of your computer sound card, then I can *highly* recommend this Magni amplifier and the separately-sold Modi DAC.As others have mentioned, the Modi/Magni stack is also very compact and looks great too!",2,2,0.0018882762,0.00764901,0.9904627

"The device works flawlessly with an Android controlling it -- I use both a Nexus tablet and a Galaxy S4. It truly is a plug-and-play device, no fuss, no muss. Right now I would say this is an exceptionally great option for streaming Google Music, if you have your music stored there (and why wouldn't you? Free cloud storage, people) as well as Google Play video content and YouTube. It's the first simple and good solution I've seen to watch YouTube on a normal TV.It's also possible to control the Chromecast with several different devices that have different libraries. It seems simple to switch among devices. The streaming happens from the cloud to the Chromecast dongle via Wi-Fi, not through your Android device, so it doesn't hog up your tablet's or phone's brain power. My understanding is that any computer or device connected to the same Wi-Fi can control the Chromecast.It is also a much cheaper option to stream Netflix and HBO GO than a Roku player; this bad boy is just $35. The other difference is that the Roku is controlled by a remote control, and the Chromecast is controlled only by an Android or iOS device. The advantage of the Roku is that using the Roku app, the Roku box can stream &#34;local&#34; content (photos and music etc. on your phone or tablet). I don't see a way to do that with the Chromecast yet, although presumably someone will create an app to do that at some point. Also the Roku has a lot more streaming services than the Chromecast right now, but for the basics, and especially Google Play Music and Video, it's the absolute best option.",2,2,0.0004837763,0.001346214,0.9981699

This case uses a practical material that is more solid (to protect your case), will not peal (so you will not absently ""pick at the strips""), and will never ever get sticky!-The texture is fabulous ... very tactile. Very, very solid!-The glossy finish is the perfect touch ... very visually appealing!-The contrast stitching on the inside is a lovely, unexpected touch. It is the same neon hue as the exterior and offers a playful punctuation to the medium-black interior. So adorable!-There is a little pocket in which to keep a few notes.-I really like the elastic straps because it allows me to quickly change-out cases.

I bought them based on the reviews here and elsewhere on the net, price, and the fact that they did actually fit in our bookcase.

Every sound was produced clearly, acccurately, and sharply with no distortion up to the limits of what I could tolerate cranking up the receiver to. I have recently added a center channel speaker and now these are the front side speakers and they are still doing a great job.

"Finally a LED Light with some guts and quality in the build.  I am getting some quality work done with this LED light.  I had tried some of the cheap LED Lights from other manufacturers that left a lot to be desired.  One of them got the battery stuck in it and I could not recharge after using it one time..  This one gives you both the intensity and the cool & warm dials. It comes with the mounting gear, a double charger with 2 great batteries.  In addition, it all stays together in a nice case that is included.  I bought this on the recommendation from Kirk Tuck's website.  I also purchased his Kindle Edition of his LED Lighting book here on Amazon.  As Kirk warns: NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE LED BULBS.  Keep a softening filter on when using these lights.  You can give yourself Retina Eye Damage.  This is a great purchase for any photographer who wants to see their subject while composing.

"See update below!!I just received my case for my Nexus 7 that I received for Christmas.  The auto on works nicely.  Unfortunately when I flip the cover all the way to the back, the tablet goes off again.  So it's going back.  I would just exchange it for another one, but the case didn't fit particularly well.  The tabs that are used to hold the Nexus in place were would not completely secure the device, and I have no confidence that it will hold the tablet without it dropping out.

Upon reading the initial review above, the seller left me a comment saying that they'd replace the cover immediately.  I emailed him and let him know that I'd already put in for a return and refund, but that I appreciated the offer.  In response, the seller told me to keep the original case, gave me instructions on how to remove the offending magnet so that I could use it as a temporary case, and shipped me a new one through first class mail.  In addition, I was refunded the purchase price!  Like I said, unbelievably good, A++ customer service.The case came yesterday, and it's perfect.  The N7 fits perfectly in it, and the auto off works without problems.  You can buy this case without worry.

"I've been reading the reviews here on amazon and across the web since I transitioned to all Apple device over the last 2 years.  My old router Netgear WNDR 3300 running DD-WRT firmware worked great.  But it was maxed out at N speeds and while it did cover our 3100 sq. foot 2 story home I wanted to increase speeds for our WiFi devices.

Everything seemed to be working perfectly.I did have to enter in a MAC & IP registration to get our MicroCell to work properly.

"I just received two of these monitors last night.  I was replacing some broken ViewSonic VG2230WMs which provided excellent service for many, many years.  The two new Acers are flanking my ViewSonic CDE3201LED 32&#34; LED-Lit center screen.  I also have 2x DoubleSight DS-70Us (7&#34;) and 1x DoubleSight DS-90U (9&#34;).  I thought this was important so you could see what I'm comparing the new Acers to.First, the Acers were SUPER easy to assemble.  All done without tools, though the screw that holds the panel to the stand will eventually get properly tightened with a screwdriver if they work out in the long term.Packaging was sufficient but responsibly done, with minimal styrofoam and maximum recyclable content.I was really surprised to see that every conceivable cable that could be used with these monitors was included in the box!  You get a VGA, DVI *and* HDMI cable for each monitor.I love the fact that the power cable is two-part power supply similar to those used with laptops.  This means that the reach of the cable is very long, and the part of the cable you'll most want to hide happens to also be the very thin, easiest to manipulate part.I plugged them in and my Windows 7 64-bit machine recognized and activated them without any interaction from me.  No drivers or special software to install.  Literally plug and play.The image would look good to me if they weren't flanking that big ViewSonic I mention above.  They all have a max resolution of 1920x1080 and that looks better at first glance on the ViewSonic.  But that resolution doesn't really hold up to over scaling like the 32&#34; ViewSonic does, so the Acers represent that pixel density much better.Text on the Acers is much more readable and very smooth.The response times are great, and videos look decent.  The ViewSonic is a bit brighter and sharper with video while the Acers take the prize for text, basic web surfing and non-animated content.So far I am very pleased with almost everything about the Acers.  Can't beat the price, of course, but the quality and completeness of the equipment that I received was great.I know that height-adjustable stands are no longer in vogue but I really miss that feature.  I'm 6' tall and find these Acers sitting way too low for comfortable use at a normally proportioned desk.  So I saved some money on the monitors themselves but now I'll have to invest in something to raise them a solid 6-7&#34; in height to achieve the recommended ergonomic configuration.  That said, even the big ViewSonic fails to meet ergonomic standards in height so it needs to be boosted 4-5&#34; itself.

Those things could tower above a desk!At this point I would only be able recommend these monitors for fairly work-a-day use -- email, spreadsheets, document editing, etc.  For video games or heavy multimedia use, I'm not sure they would be as sharp and bright as you might hope.  I'll certainly update this if I find that my experience over time changes this opinion but I have already tried some videos and have a strong preference for the big ViewSonic's performance on media.",2,2,0.008502318,0.018292831,0.9732049

"A year ago I ordered my computer directly from Cyberpowerpc. They are available on Amazon and I strongly recommend them because mine has been super reliable. The main reason I went to Cyberpower's site was that you can build a computer using exactly the components you want. I guess it's one of the benefits of being a nerd.When I had finished I noticed that each component was from a different manufacturer, except one manufacturer who had supplied three of the items in the computer. That was Corsair, and I had chosen them because they were great value and had very good reviews elsewhere. I have a Corsair power supply, Corsair memory, and a Corsair solid-state disk. Even my CPU watercooler was made by a company that supplies to Corsair and you can buy them under the Corsair brand.Since then, Corsair has expanded into selling cases, keyboards and mice, and also sells USB memory sticks. But this review is about the gaming headsets which, like all Corsair products, have attracted a great deal of attention. And I can see why.I don't know why one reviewer complained that the headset was uncomfortable. I found it the most comfortable of any headsets I've tried, to the degree that I had to think carefully whether I actually had them on. The sound, needless to say, was great and was at least as good as other gaming headsets I've tried.The headset has a wireless connection with a small transmitter/receiver at the end of a USB lead.  Corsair claims that it has a range of up to forty feet, so I will be able to dictate reviews without even getting out of bed. This degree of utility has been sadly lacking in the computer world lately, forcing poor reviewers to get up and dressed before they can write a single word.The thing that interested me most was the microphone. Not that I was playing multiplayer games where I had to talk to my colleagues, but because, like now, I use microphones for my Dragon Dictate program. Obviously, the program has to interpret what I say, and this is the best microphone I've tried. My accuracy rate is the highest it's ever been.I hate to say that I had to use something that is highly reckoned - Corsair's technical support. Although there was nothing wrong with the headphones I had managed to screw up Windows 8 sounds and had to email Corsair to be given instructions on the way to reset it. They replied promptly and asked only the questions that were necessary. Excellent service.About the only thing that I dislike about this headset is a newbie problem. To turn them on you have to hold down the on/ off button for a couple of seconds. I didn't realize this from the instructions. However I don't see this problem coming up again.Once again, Corsair has produced a great product. I took a look at the on-line reviews from the enthusiast sites, and they were as pleased as I was.

"When I found out about the new touch and tilt features of the Wacom Intuos 5, I started drooling. But the price tag was, as always, immensely steep, and being new to the tablet scene, I wasn't even sure how I would take to digital art or whether the professional tablet was worth the investment.  The Wacom Bamboo Create bridges the gap between their professional Intuous series and the Bamboo calligraphic tablet.This is a full-sized tablet, complete with some of the same touch controls of the Intuos including rotate, move, and zoom. Although it only features half of the pressure sensitivity, for the amateur artist you aren't going to notice the difference.  In fact, I've gotten quite a bit out of the 1024 levels of pressure just by tweaking my brush settings in Photoshop.Of course, there are features missing.  The Bamboo Create doesn't have much in the way of button customization, and with a lot of somewhat useless controls mapped to its buttons, it seems like such a frustrating waste of functionality. For instance, I would love to have mapped &#34;undo&#34; to a swipe motion, or even surface button of the tablet. Alas, not possible.  The Create also lacks the tilt feature, which changes the brush shape on the Intuos 5 model depending on how the pen is tilted, though similar effects can be achieved by altering brush settings.All in all this was an excellent introduction to digital tablet art and design.  It has plenty of functionality to master the basic, intermediate, and even some advanced skill of digital art. And is more than suited to the amateur artist or graphic designer looking to gain an advantage and move away from the mouse.For the price, this tablet does everything I wanted a tablet to do, and plenty of things I'm not even good enough to make it do yet, so while the Intuos has some obvious advantages, I don't see any reason to spend the extra $300. If you are new the tablet world, you can't go wrong with mastering the Wacom Bamboo Create first.",2,2,0.0020836901,0.010720093,0.9871962

"I bought this in September 2009 and have not found anything bad about it. The only thing that I could complain about is the fact that if I start moving my car before the GPS has locked on to the current location, then often it gets confused (hence the 4 star; it should actually be 4.9 star :). So now I have learned to wait till the signal reception turns green from red (which honestly does not take long at all).Overall, the product is fast, accurate, and the text-to-speech works great.

I could certainly do with a little louder voice but given the price I paid for this device, I should not complain about it.

Just to be clear, I do not use this monitor for gaming, as I do most of my gaming on Xbox and PS3.Pros:The price is perfect for what you get.  There may be others around the same price, but I bought this one, so I can't compare.Incredible color and brightness to get accurate adjustments in photo manipulation software.Perfect size for me (27 inch monitor)Movies look great! Photos look amazing!Matte finish so there is hardly any glare at all.  This is important to me as the high gloss is just too reflective for my taste.Has built in speakers (I don't use them, but it is there for some sound, even if they aren't the best, it is something)Text looks very good and crisp.There are a few options for connectivity. I personally use HDMI and it adjusts perfectly to the screen.I didn't have to adjust anything (brightness, color) since mine came out of the box to my liking.

"Well, I have three of these capture cards. I'm using them in a Mac Pro, and use the software ""Wirecast"" to switch between the three cards for a monthly web show. The cards work well enough; I use three consumer-grade HD camcorders (Canon HV30) for camera video, and have captured with an iPad 2 as well (does not work with an iPad 1, and haven't been able to get it to work with my Android tablet yet). Summary of my experience:- the setup for these cards is pretty undocumented, so you're sort of on your own. The control panel interface for the cards is somewhat vague as well; if you know what you're doing, you'll figure it out, it just might take some time.- if you have more than one card in your system, the control panel (either Mac or Windows) will not uniquely identify them, so when you go to change the settings, you'll get a drop-down window that simply says ""Blackmagic Intensity Pro"", not knowing if you're changing the settings for card 1, card 2, card 3, etc. That's not a very good design.- I think that there used to be some pretty decent capture software that came with the card, but as far as I can tell, they changed it (for the worse) and you can no longer get the older software. I contacted them and they said that it was discontinued.- If you're using the card as a switcher for a live show, it works well enough. There's a fairly robust community in the Wirecast forums using these cards, so despite Blackmagic's lack of documentation and information, they can usually get you going.- The card does not support 1080p30 as far as I can tell. I had to set the card up to capture in 720p...which is probably fine since switching between three cards, I don't know if the system would be able to keep up with three 1080p30 streams anyway.- In Wirecast, I HAVE been able to get my iPad 2 video to show up (using the HDMI-out adapter). iPad 1 video does not show up (Apple limitation), and I haven't been able to get my Android tablet to show up (possibly a framerate problem, according to Wirecast forums).Overall, this is a good card. Lack of information and support from Blackmagic is probably the weakest link. If you're just looking to do a simple HDMI capture (i.e. not switching like me), you might want to consider the AverMedia HD DVR HDMI capture card, because it is about half the price, and works well enough for simple captures (that card is Windows-only though, whereas Blackmagic's works on Mac and Windows).",2,2,0.0047479994,0.019906353,0.9753456

"When the 790SW first came out, I read a positive review in a newspaper on it. At the time, I decided that its ruggedness & water resistance were worth having but I wasn't in the market for a new camera at the time.This summer, I started researching the Stylus SW's and decided to buy an 850 from Amazon, based mostly on what I read here. I took it on a two week cruise to Europe as soon as I got it. The xD card is not a problem for me - even my local supermarket carries them. I bought my 2 gig one from Target but would have bought online if I'd had the time. I've had the camera since October 8, 2008.In Italy and Croatia, xD cards were readily available in the local camera shops.A bigger problem for me is the battery. It is tiny and fairly easy to recharge but I found I need to recharge it every day that I use the camera. My next purchase will be two additional batteries. I would accept a bit more camera bulk for a more capatious battery and the ability to charge it without removing it from the camera.You DO need to be careful not to put the battery in the wrong way but if you look CLOSELY at the camera, it's pretty obvious. I wonder how long the tiny red plastic catch that releases the battery so you can get it out, will last?Picture quality is plenty good enough for my purposes and I take all my pix on the 4MP setting. I was especially pleased with the low light capabilities with the flash switched off.I DID read the manual but I found that it was just as easy to push buttons on the control panel and scroll through the menus to do what I needed to do. I tried the video once & it's OK but I can't see me using it much.I haven't used the underwater capability yet and I do have the floating wrist strap but would want to have the floating neck strap before taking my 850SW to the beach.I would like to have the option of an optical viewfinder but this is in no way a deal killer for me.This should really be a 5 star review but I never give ANYTHING 5 stars!",2,2,0.004878308,0.007426251,0.98769546
"This is a very good little transmitter.  The manufacturers sent me one to test and review, and I am very happy with it.The unit itself is compact (about 6cm x 2.5cm x 1cm), weighs just a few grammes and looks very neat.  It has a nifty fold-away 3.5mm jack plug which, when plugged into the output of my mp3 player, forms a tidy double unit with the player itself.In use, it has a full range of FM frequencies to transmit on so if you run into interference you can easily change frequencies, and a small but clear digital display of the frequency.  The reception on my car radio is excellent, with very clear sound and no distortion or hiss.  I've tried it on my living-room stereo, too and it's fine up to a range of well over 3 metres, meaning that I can play my mp3s through the stereo while having the player next to me on the sofa to control.  Again, the sound is very good.By turning up the volume on the mp3 player to nearly maximum, the level of sound coming from the radio is similar to other FM stations but it does mean you need to watch you don't forget to re-adjust and accidentally blow your head off next time you use the player with headphones.

Canon XSi with kit lens (18-55mm) fits fine in the primary compartment.  A lens compartment goes to the 10-22mm wide angle.  The other lens compartment can fit my 60mm macro.  Any big lens (like 70-200mm) you will probably run into problems.A bigger camera also will have problems.  I don't think a 50D will fit there with a mounted lens bigger than a 50mm.I put the 10-22mm in the space that'll go next to my side.  I don't know how well it'll do if it gets whacked from the side, but the material isn't cushy thick.  I may consider taking out the outer facing side padding and finding a thicker one (or making it a little thicker with some foam wrapping material).Pros:fits in Timbuk2 small and bigger sizeslight and easy to organize your gearGreat for my Canon Rebel XSicons:larger camera body owners might dislike this insert.no padding underneathouter padding could be thickerno adjustable compartmentsDespite all the adjustments I've had to make, I'm giving it a 4 star as this insert is NOT designed for Timbuk2 but for the F-2 Domke bag which is built to handle the bumps and bruises as camera bag should.Update 12/28/2011:So after 1.5 years with this bag in my Timbuk2 bag, I conclude that this insert is totally worth it.  I've gone to Spain, Japan, Hong Kong, Macao, Venezuela and it holds up very well.  At first I babied my camera but after awhile I would just let it bump or bang around everywhere.I actually wish I had the Timbuk2 classic messenger bag medium size as this insert makes things tighter than I would like.  However, the insert is a great option if you already have a Timbuk2 bag (small or larger).Also, the velcro does have a tendancy to stick to things in the bag which is a plus or minus.Currently in the bag, I have my kit lens (18-55mm) and the 55-250mm attached.I still have room for a flash and random knick nacks (battery, cleaning pen, wb cards, SD cards and sunblock).  When I went to Spain, I actually managed to shove a netbook I borrowed into the bag alongside the gear I originally mentioned.  These days I pack my Kindle (3g keyboard).I also purchased a battery grip and surpisingly this fits very well in the insert when attached to the camera body.  However, I find that when the two batteries are drained, and you have to detach the battery grip to load the one spare battery, it's a pain to store.  This is solved by buying another battery and just popping out the 2 drained ones and popping in the fresh ones.Overall this insert is great to use as a camera bag hack for an existing Timbuk2 classic messenger bag (medium or larger).  I would advise to get one of the newer Timbuk2 camera bags if you do not already have one.I would advise to get one of the newer Timbuk2 camera bag if you do not already have one.I believe this product scores a 4 star still.",2,2,0.0015999499,0.026518796,0.9718812

"I was debating getting this zoom level with or without IS(I have a T2i). I'm very glad I got it with IS.

My point and shoot still zooms farther but of course doesn't get as good of images or have IS. This is really good for getting images of animals that would otherwise run if you got close. I have no real complaints about this lens.One thing I will point out, it seems to be a slight issue with a UV filter on this lens when it is zoomed. You get some bad internal light reflections. This happens with a cheapo UV filter and a nice one I have. Only noticeable at night. I don't count off because the lens without a filter works great.

"All features advertised work well. Many reviewers have done a great job. I followed Tickle's step-by-step instruction and the installation was a breeze.In order to do the remote monitoring outside your house, you have to configure your router to allow you to get into your home network. The port forwarding setting is a task which varies from router to router. You will have to be a little network savvy in order to get this setting up. For example, I have a TrendNet router. The manual did not explain how to perform the port forwarding. I searched on internet and found an instruction which did not make 100% sense. I had to make a small guess and made it work.The best feature of this product is that, once the feature is turned on, it will email you your IP address if your network provider changes your IP address. During my recent trip to Asia, my IP address was changed 4 times. I could access my home network with new IP address. If there would be a hacker to my home network, he/she could not get in after IP address is changed. This makes me feel much better to open up my home network a bit. Still, as soon as I got home, I deactivate the port forwarding setting in my router just to be safe.The motion detection works well when I set the sensitivity to 5. I have a lamp which is turned on and off by a timer. The motion detection detected the light change and emailed me a series of photos. This is a good assurance feature. I get to see the photo twice a day even there was non event to let me know the Foscam is working hard to watch my house for me. When I got home after the trip, I triggered the motion detection. I was pleasantly informed via my email that my home was invaded with my pictures in there.The resolution of the camera is not very high. However, I had to set the resolution even lower in order to view it via my DSL which has limited upload speed. So, practically, I am limited by my internet connection. This makes me think about switching to other internet provider.I highly recommend this camera.

My needs for a GPS unit were several, including going geocaching with my two children, the need to have a unit that could give me street navigation (I purchased the City Navigator card also), as well as for use while distance walking.  Some things that others may want to consider - the learning curve is simple.  Having used the Etrex Legend in the past, the menus on the Oregon are really simple and self-explanatory.  It's quick at locating satellites, and locking in your location.  I added a screen protector, as in the past having used Palm Pilots, there were several times these came in handy for protection.  My one and only fault I can find is that geocache locations once loaded into the GPS can only be deleted when you then attach to the PC, and delete through Windows (come on Garmin, make this something I can do from the unit itself!)

"Our 13 year old Sony crapped out last week and it's amazing how quickly you discover how dependent you have gotten on TV news, weather and sports programs. We did our Consumer's Reports research on reliability and quality - Panasonic was highly rated. Armed with that info, we went shopping. With our great experience with Sony products, we looked at their offerings as well, but when we considered price / performance / value, the Panasonic TVs seemed like they were a best buy.The 50 inch model was the largest screen that could fit in our family room space. Happily, setup was a snap and we were watching the news and weather in about 20 minutes (including taking the huge cardboard box out to the truck).Interestingly, we discovered that our old HD cable box did not have an HDMI connection port so on the HD stations, the picture quality wasn't crisp. Hmmmm. A quick trip to our local cable support store and a swap out for the newest box and it was instant ""wow!"" for the crisp colors, sharp pictures and high quality sound through the built in speakers.We have yet to experiment with the web interface (Hulu, Facebook, Netfilx, etc.,) although connecting it wirelessly could not have been easier.

"I am not going to go too deep into the technical side of the Slingbox, enough people before me have done that.  For me, it works great with my Verizon FIOS here in Northern New Jersey.  I use it to watch TV in my office upstairs, so I don't have to add a TV up here.  I also use it to watch TV from home when I travel.  I have used it as far away from home as China, Poland and Australia.

"Installed this to my '06 Toyota Corolla S a month ago, and I'm in love with it. The main reason why I purchased this was because I wanted to use my Ipod to listen to music, rather than burn so many CDs every few weeks.  I read the reviews on Amazon, and they were so helpful before I decided to purchase it.  I think the price is perfect for what it's worth. Even though you don't have a touch screen or a navigation system attached to this, it still features a whole lot of what you may need it to do.  I have only been using the USB port to hook up my Ipod to. Reason is because I do not own a smartphone (yet) to use the Bluetooth feature as well as the Satellite radio. The sound quality has been really crisp, and it's also great to change the equilizer to fit the quality of sound you are searching for.The only thing I have noticed that makes me a little upset it that I can't play any of my podcasts on the stereo.  I'm not sure if it's because they are about an hour plus long of a track, but I doubt that could be the problem.  When I press ""Band"" to get to the main menu of the Ipod, the ""Podcasts"" just doesn't show up at all, like it's not an option.  I even tried to make sure I manually added it to my Ipod, and created my own playlist for podcasts, but still... nothing.  Maybe someone out there knows how to find their podcast listings and could tell me how to play them through this stereo?Aside from all of that, this car stereo is awesome, and worth the buy for an after market stereo. I'm not a car tech saavy kind of girl, so I had to go to Best Buy to install it for me ($59.99). If you have all of the hardware you need, they are able to just put it together for you.

"There is probably little I can add to the general specs that many reviewers have not already spelled out. However, here is my personal experience and path from 'oh no' (when unpacking) to 'oooh' (after a day).Needless to repeat: The gTablet as delivered comes with horrible firmware to the point of un-usability. It is unresponsive and the applications sluggish. Fortunately, pretty much immediately after gaining wireless access the tablet offers an update to a more recent firmware which installs itself and reboots the device in a matter of minutes. The result is a dramatic increase in speed and better applications. While that is all nice and good - without access to the Android market the software would leave a lot to be desired. Yes, you can read your PDFs using the Adobe Reader (which sucks on Android) or you could get ezPDF off the market - if you could access it. Wouldn't it be great if you could rent movies from the market, watch your NetFlix account and play any of the endless number of free or dirt-cheap games off the market? Once you realize this the shiny gTablet and its market alternative look underwhelming. I felt pretty disappointed. However, after a day of Googling and a USB stick I managed to custom flash my ROM (there are many custom versions freely available) the market can be fully unlocked - and what a difference it makes. (While the process of 'flashing it' sounds dangerous and only for the geek - it's really a five minute process that requires little to no technical know-how.)Seriously, out of the box I felt the gTablet was a *very cool* calculator and email program but that was about it. When custom ROM flashed this dirt cheap appliance is a serious iPad contender. NetFlix video plays back in HD quality and pretty much any market app I purchased or downloaded for free worked flawlessly. I do not fully understand the reasons for the problems the stock device has accessing the market (Viewsonic has a new, better and more expensive device in the works that can?!?!) but once unlocked the sky is pretty much the limit.The only minor gripe I have is with the screen and its limited viewing angle but it's within the limits of my pain threshold.At the price that this tablet now sells for (~$260 as of this writing) it's a steal.",2,2,0.045586884,0.08309419,0.87131894

The camera is protected from all sides (memory foam in the front, and a soft thick material on the other sides).I've packed on mine:- The camera- A mini tripod- USB cable- AV cables- Extra sets of batteries- Extra memory cards with cases- Cleaning cloth- Camera quick start guide (folded in half)The back is molded and waterproof.

"As a review model, I'm replacing anASUS (RT-N56U) Black Diamond Dual Band Wireless-N 600 Router, Hardware NAT, 5 Internal Antennas, AI Radar and Graphical Traffic Monitorthat I've been using for a few months. Which is actually a very good Access Point/Router for comparison. I've had the N900 up as a full time router for about 2 weeks now and overall it's been pretty solid. I really don't have any complaints. The setup is fairly straight-forward as well. No software is needed. Just connect to the device via the IP address and walk through the wizard. Then you're done.I ran some speed test before and after switching out the devices and there was virtually no difference between the two, both in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. They both were running the latest firmware as well.I've included my speed test results below as a reference. Due to the nature of wireless, your results will most likely vary. This is in a 2 story 2800 sq/ft house, located in a typical neighborhood with plenty of interference from other APs. To test, I simply copied large 5-20GB movies from various places in the house from a notebook.5GHz:2nd FloorSame Room, 5ft - 22MB/secMedia Room, 20ft - 22MB/secGym Room, 30ft - 16MB/sec1st FloorKitchen, 20ft - 17.5MB/secBedroom, 45ft - 15MB/secGarage, 55ft - 11MB/secBackyard, 80ft - 4MB/sec2.4GHz:2nd FloorSame Room, 5ft - 22MB/secMedia Room, 20ft - 22MB/secGym Room, 30ft - 16MB/sec1st FloorKitchen, 20ft - 8MB/secBedroom, 45ft - 15MB/secGarage, 55ft - 11MB/secBackyard, 80ft - 2MB/secNothing too surprising here. There's obviously less interference on the 5GHz band (only 1 neighbor has a 5GHz AP), so it gets better speeds is most cases. If there are cases where 2.4GHz dropped in speed, I could easily look at a WiFi scanner and see that there was a lot more interference from the neighbors in that particular area.Unfortunately all of the 2.4GHz channels are used in my area, so the 5GHz is really the way to go. So as far as transfer speeds and wireless signal goes, this device met all expectations.What really separates the N900 from the Asus that it replaced is that this has noticeably more features. Which is something you should consider when spending the extra cash for the N900. If you don't need extra features such as guest network access, parental controls, and USB storage - you might as well save some cash and get the Asus. The features, which I should note, are rather basic - but functional. Which honestly, other than the guest network, I didn't play with too much as I don't really have a need for them. That's all handled by a dedicated home server and firewall.Overall, I consider this unit highly recommended as a top-of-the-line Router/Access Point.",2,2,0.0009239684,0.003983064,0.995093

I woke up more than a few mornings after having plugged in our iPhones the night before to find that they had not charged at all with this charger, and all our other devices were charged and ready to go. Having played around with it a bit more I figured out that in a perfectly horizontal or vertical position the problem does not repeat.

"It's huge.I had purchased a 56"" Panny plasma last year. It has an awesome picture and is a fabulous TV. However, with the sound system I have going down there (classic KEF Reference all the way around plus the legendary Alon isobaric sub, driven by the top Marantz HDMI receiver) I found the picture from the plasma was still a little SMALL for the sound!This I hadn't anticipated.56"" was the hugest screen I'd ever bought. Well, I blew the plasma out the door when the new Mitsu rear-projection DLP units with 3-D came out, and I'm glad I did.It was between this and a projector. My brother built a front projector system in his basement, and honestly it's disappointing. You have to have the room totally dark, and even then the picture isn't very bright.This DLP set, by contrast, is far brighter, and you can watch it during the day or with the lights on. It is HUGE, which really complements the sound system. It's really not right to have top-shelf sound without a theater-worthy screen, and 56"" is just on the small end of that, unless your room is tiny.Once I had the color balance tweaked to the calibration disc's satisfaction, I had great things going on. The Panny had great color out of the box, but the factory settings on the Mitsu DLP units are mushy and a bit off. So if you do buy this set, by all means make sure you do a full calibration with a good calibration dvd/blu-ray disc. The before/after difference is quite striking even if you're not a real ""video geek."" The discs themselves are amazingly cheap, and if you're spending this much on a TV there's really no excuse not to set it up right. I believe many negative reviewers simply weren't able to get the calibration done so their nice new screen looks right.Blu-Ray presentation of color-intensive films like 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' are spectacular on this set. Fast-moving sports like Hockey and baseball render lightning-fast, unlike the ever-popular LCD screens that show a black streak on the ice instead of a puck. And of course, you get the most inches per dollar of any HDTV technology out there.My sister has an older DLP Sony Grand WEGA set, and when the bulb finally popped on that thing, they had to pop for almost $300 to replace it, and then it was a huge rigamarole to get it replaced.The bulb on this TV is around a hundred twenty bucks which is a steal for this kind of high-output light source. And it is 100% user replaceable. That is what sold me on this TV. Because at that low price for a bulb, I can keep a spare on hand at all times and if the thing blows I can quickly get it up and running again.I can't stress enough how important this feature is for anyone looking at rear-projection DLP. Your bulb is going to blow. It's a wear item, like brakes on your car. Designing the system so that the user can replace the bulb is so smart, Mitsu should get a medal. Designing the bulb so that it can be sold for around a hundred bucks: awesome.How does the picture compare with the Panasonic plasma? The plasma is better. Blacks: blacker. Whites: whiter. Action: faster. Viewing angles: WAY wider. But the plasma just ain't big enough for my application, and a plasma the size of this gigantic DLP will cost you your firstborn child. The brightness and video quality penalty is the trade-off for the eye-popping size of this screen. It was totally worth it for me, and the experience with the bigger screen really blows away the higher plasma quality for me.So you know where I'm at with this TV. If you are looking for the home theater experience, I recommend you stop looking at flatscreens and projectors. You've found the right TV type and the right brand. Mitsu stuck with rear projection DLP and refined it while so many others were switching over to all flatscreen, all the time. Those of us non-millionaires for whom there's no substitute for screen real estate are very happy they did.Go to your local Mitsubishi DLP dealer and see these big things in action. Choose the model that fits you best, and start shopping that model. $3100 for this TV is a gettable deal, and you may be able to get it for that just by offering that price to your local Mitsu guy. You'll pay for delivery, but the charge will be similar to what you pay the Amazon affiliates who sell this TV--and you'll have a local warranty, which is very desirable on something of this magnitude.If your personal economy allows you to spend three thousand bucks on a tv, I would definitely put this one on your list of tvs to shop.You won't be sorry.",2,2,0.008011148,0.014267184,0.97772163

"My laptop is a nice PC, but the tiny speakers don't have much volume or clarity. I connected the IC-BTT01 Bluetooth transmitter to the headphone port, then paired it with a portable Bluetooth speaker I use with my tablet. Pairing was very quick, and the audio from the speaker was far superior to the laptop's sound. Granted, I could have hard-wired the speaker, but a wireless connection gave a lot more freedom to move the speaker, and it avoided having another cable cluttering up my desktop.I also used the transmitter with an old Radio Shack portable radio that I keep next to my PC for listening to news and sports. I inserted the transmitter cable into the radio's headphone port, then paired the transmitter with the Bluetooth speaker. Again, pairing was very quick, and in a few seconds, I was listening to much better quality audio than with the radio's speakers.A USB charging cable is included with the transmitter. Don't lose the cable, since it has a proprietary plug that plugs into a small port on the side of the transmitter. The transmitter can be recharged from a USB port of a computer or plugged into an AC charger.My verdict: This is a really handy little gadget with a number of uses both inside and outside the home. If you have an audio device that lacks Bluetooth capability, just connect the IC-BTT01 Bluetooth transmitter to the headphone port and pump the audio into a Bluetooth speaker for better sound and more portability.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",2,2,0.0027286804,0.007139288,0.990132
"I am really happy with the purchase of this monitor.  I haven't seen too many reviews on it, so I was bit skeptical at first when purchasing it.  It is the perfect size, 5ms response time, HDCP compliant, 16:9, and has a 20000:1 contrast ratio.  One of the things about monitors in this size is the 16:9 viewing ratio - Some are not, and if you are interested in watching HDTV on your monitor then you'll have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, which I personally don't like.  Pairs well with a Blu-ray player and HDCP compliant video card.  I'm using it for all sorts of tasks - video and picture editing, blu-ray movies, internet, etc.  I'm not a gamer so I can't comment on that end of it.  All in all, a great value for the size and quality.One note on the stand assembly:  Use a bit of olive oil and place it around the rubber ring on the inside of the stand insert.  This helps the stand slide into place much more easily, and will not hurt the monitor as long as you use the olive oil sparingly.",2,2,0.000599067,0.002144325,0.9972567

"So I got this item to supplement my ROKU collection, I placed it in the master bedroom while all others have the Roku. I have to say I love the ability to control it from my cell phone or (cast). I would have given this 5 stars but I am waiting for my integration with websites and other services besides netflix.It works great, one thing I would say to others is to insure you have a good speed on your internet plus wi-fi connection or strong signal, this will obviously enhance your video quality. The size is right, make sure you have an HDMI on your TV, you will need a USB connector for power, the dongle has a wire from it into the USB for power.

"Conventional camera straps are good for what they're designed for: carrying your camera around your neck and keeping your hands-free when your DSLR is not in use. But they are not always the best choice for street photography, shooting sports, quick action shots, or when going from handheld to tripod.TheCotton Carrier Hand Strap - with Arca-Swiss compatible mini-plateis a good solution for any photographer on the go, and in almost any environment. This hand strap has an adjustable Velcro-type strip, and the plate is made of black anodized aluminum. In terms of use, this means that you can put the camera onto your tripod head in seconds, without removing the hand strap at all.This product comes in a straightforward cardboard box, and inside is the hand strap, the Arca-Swiss style mini-plate, a camera mounting screw, an Allen wrench to tighten the camera screw, and a small split ring for other mount alternatives. Setup is fast and easy, and the Velcro-type strip allows for fast adjustments of the hand strap in the fly. The Arca-Swiss compatible mini-plate has a standard -20 UNC screw mount, so that once it's installed to the camera and adjusted, you're ready to go. Have tried this with myVanguard BBH-200 Tripod Headand another from Manfrotto, and the fit is excellent on both.This has been used on a couple of Nikon DSLRs, one with a battery grip and the other without. It's almost a given that that it would easily fit the plain DSLR body for which it was initially intended, but the pleasant surprise was that it easily fit the camera with the battery grip. When shooting with a longer lens, such as theNikon 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX Nikkor, the added stability and handling is quite noticeable. It's excellent for use when taking those one-handed candid shots that come up so often.One small but important note: a friend was interested in my hand strap, but we found a problem where it would not fit properly. Mounting the Arca-Swiss compatible mini-plate interfered with opening the battery door on the base of the camera, which could be a nuisance in the field when you need to change batteries. Before ordering this hand strap, take a moment to measure your camera base from the center of its tripod socket to the battery door. If that distance is "" or less you may have issues opening the battery door; if it's an inch or more you shouldn't have any problems.TheCotton Carrier Hand Strapis a good one for the photographer who prefers having the camera at the ready, in hand and geared up for that next shot. It lets you shoot handheld compositions with greater stability, and the Arca-Swiss compatible mini-plate allows for fast transitions from handheld to tripod with heavier camera bodies and lenses... and without the neck strain of a conventional out-of-the-box strap. It's a good one, and why I have a pair of these.JW &#9642; 4/14/2014",2,2,0.0021332763,0.03779155,0.9600752

"Far better than most of the VESA mounting products I have previously seen close to this price range.  Matte black finish looks fine; adjusting everything is fairly easy. One of the black bolts in the packaging to attach the clamp down at the base had a damaged thread I had a burr that I had to file off before I could get it threaded; that issue might have been a deal-breaker for some folks.  The dual-mount versions use through-hole bolts to lock in the height of the arm, this one uses a pressure clamp sorta setup.

"I bought the original 2 Gig Clip after owning several other brands of small mp3 players.  It was by far the best player I'd owned and served me well for 2 yrs.  The only drawback was capacity.  When I saw the Clip+, there was no doubt what my next player would be.I bought the 8GB Clip+ and paired it with a Kingston 16GB microSDHC card.  Capacity problem solved!  24GB on a small, lightweight, easy to use player for less than $100.  You don't see that every day.  When prices come down on the 32GB memory cards, 40GB will be a piece of cake.I was a bit concerned about battery life after reading some of the reviews here.  I've run my Clip+ through 4 complete cycles in the last few weeks, recharging when the battery life on the ""info"" screen dropped below 7% (I noticed that the graphic battery indicator is not as accurate as on the old Clip).  I averaged 12.5 hours of playing time per charge.  That was with the 16GB memory card, power saver set to 5 min. and using the screen functions a lot.  Basically, it's about the same as the old Clip which works for me.The player seamlessly combines all files in onboard memory and the external card.  The only time you treat them separately is when loading the player.  In mass storage mode (i.e. thumb drive), your computer will show separate folders for the onboard memory and the external card.Sound quality has always rated high marks on Sansa's Clip series and this one is no exception.  Whether I'm playing it through earbuds or my car or home audio system, the sound quality is excellent. A nice feature is the audio recording.  I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised at how well it works.All in all, I'm thrilled with the Clip+.  It has everything I loved about the original Clip, plus some improved ergonomics (on/off button, volume control) and a sturdier clip.  I don't do playlists or syncing with software on my computer, so that is best left to other reviewers.  I just dumped all my audio files on to the device and use its excellent operating system to navigate by artist, album, tite, favorites, etc...  It couldn't be easier.Long term follow up :  It's been 3.5 years and my Clip+ is still running great.  I would have thought that the tiny battery would have been exhausted by now, but it still works as well as it did on the day I bought it.",2,2,0.0009157071,0.0032192396,0.9958651

"This is the BEST capture card ever created for consumer use, it owns the PVR in just about every way.HDMI and Component inputs/outputs give amazing flexibility, allowing you to record from just about any HD device.

If you want the fancy formats, like AVI 8-bit or 10-bit, you'll need RAID.This card isn't as system intensive as people say it is. I've seen lots of people buy a brand new system and put this card in it, when I say they should have bought the Shuttle, which is exactly what this card is but external (you need x58 chipset or better and USB 3.0 to use the Shuttle).Overall, I have never been happier with a capture card.

"Sony's new Sony DPP-F700 7-Inch Digital Photo Frame & Printer reviewed here is a cool gadget considering the fact that it is not only a Digital Photo Frame but also includes a color 4x6"" inch postcard Photo printer which can be used on the device itself or it can be accessed via the USB port with a PC, The drivers for the printer are included in the provided CD.The Digital Photo Frame has an excellent display quality; The Black frame has a glossy finish which will fit any room d&eacute;cor, the images are clear, bright, vibrant full of color and come out very pretty. It is almost like viewing on a high end LCD panel. The Printer is an added bonus and print quality is pretty good.The Black glossy photo frame does pick up fingerprints easily, but if you use the included full function remote control you do not need to touch the unit. I love the illuminated front panel on the unit which lights up once you move your fingers on it, Sony has included some nice touches to the unit and the buttons are laid out nicely and functions very well.The Digital Photo frame has 1GB on board memory which can be accessed via USB or the device has the capability to import pictures on it's own from the SD slot. The instruction manual provided is very well detailed and easy to read. It has tons of features that are well documented. The basic functions can be activated even without reading the manual which emphasizes that the menu interface is nice!The included printer does make the unit slightly heavier and increases the depth of the unit, on the other side, it does make this unit very stable on the surface, I personally like to keep the unit flat on the surface and tilt the screen for optimal viewing angle, in this way you can use the printer whenever needed.PROS:[+]  Wide Screen high Quality Digital Photo Frame plus bonus 4x6"" Photo Printer built-in[+]  1GB onboard memory for storing your favorite photos.[+]  Image sensor for automatic photo orientation in the frame[+]  No need for PC to load photos and print photos, it can import directly from SD/CF cards[+]  Good Quality Photo printout in less than 50 secondsCONS:[-]  Slightly bulky and heavy[-]  Printer ink and photo paper print pack is optionalWhen you buy this please consider that your order includesSony Photo Printer Paper 40 sheets (SVM-F40P/2)orSony 4 x 6-Inch Print Pack with Snap-Off Edges for DPP-F Printers (SVM-F120P)The DPP-F700 7-Inch Digital Photo Frame/Printer is a very well built device, It has some nice touches, excellent menu interface, Tons of features like calendar, variety of clocks, it however lacks sound or clock radio, but includes printer which is a nice welcome feature for some who wants to instantly print a favorite photo and share it.",2,2,0.0007926854,0.0032825046,0.99592483
"These glasses are lightweight, work well over prescription glasses, or without, and have a superb picture with my Samsung PN59D6500 HDTV.  The surface of the glasses even seem to clean easily when fingerprints get on them.  They do darken the TV picture a little but not bad.  I used them to watch the IMAX Under The Sea 3d movie and the 3D effects are great! Much better 3D effects than in any movie theater. I have not used them long enough to know about battery life yet.  The only problem with these glasses is the poor documentation, particularly regarding the power on/off features.  As other reviews commented, the glasses turn off automatically when they do not detect a 3D signal from the TV.  I thought they were broken at first when the green (on) and red (off) lights did not come on when pressing the button (only the pairing light would come on).  Amazon's reviewers saved me by giving me the hint about automatic power off.  After further testing I discovered that the green and red light only come on when the 3D signal is detected from the TV. The 3D signal from the TV can only be turned on when the TV detects 3D media in the 3D blu-ray player.  So, if the pairing light comes on but the green and red lights don't, then just turn off the pairing light (press the button once) and the glasses will be off.  It was really strange because I called Samsung tech support about this and they didn't even know the answer.  Thank you Amazon reviewer ""tech support""!",2,2,0.015990186,0.0984485,0.88556135

"I had a Cisco ASA5505 that failed after a couple of years' service.With the failure, I needed a replacement security appliance that had all the feature set of the ASA, but didn't break the bank.I initially ordered a SonicWall TZ105. That turned out to be a disaster.The TZ105 had a GREAT interface for configuring the device... but failed in the performance department. At the time, I had internet service coming into the building that was 105Mbit down / 20Mbit up.With the TZ105, the throughput for the device, even vanilla, was only 64Mbit down / 20Mbit up. I ended up returning the device.Now, this ZyWALL, while not the prettiest configuration via http it is still adequate.The bonus? I'm now getting my full 105Mbit down speed and 20 Mbit upload speeds. Even with the Content Filtering and IDP enabled.This device feels really solid when taken out of the box, unlike the SonicWALL. It reminded me of my old ASA 5505.Configuration was a breeze. I was able to set 3 ports to LAN1 and the last port to the DMZ for my VPN / Mail server no problem.Firewall rules are very simple to set up.This device is FAST. The built-in bandwidth reporting per IP address is very nice.Like any security appliance, the &#34;bonus&#34; features are licensed annually.

"It's great as in overclocking is very simple as usual with AMD and you can OC a lot. One thing though is you really should expect to purchase an after market heatsink and some thermal compound - the money is in the processor and rare material made to make it - not what's actually cooling it. Seriously, do not buy this unless you don't want to overclock (then whats the point in buying this) or you are willing to buy some after market cooling. As we speak I'm facing high temp warnings using what came with the package.H60 by Corsair seems to be cheap, available here at Amazon and is liquid cooling which is hands down the best, with high reviews.One more thing is if you buy Intel instead of AMD, there's a likely chance you will end up paying about the same for the simple fact that Intel is far far more energy efficient so your electric bill will be less thus you can get an overall nicer CPU even if it cant overclock.. and with that, if your CPU is already good enough where it doesn't need to be overclocked then that's much better in itself... it's one reason why Apple and many corporations pick Intel. They're both American companies but Intel seems to make more of an effort at keeping jobs at home so thats another perk.

I assume the deeper &#34;barrel&#34; acts as a place for the drivers to resonate and form some average bass despite the lack of a sub woofer.Volume: These things do get do decent volume levels, but I have not put them past a third of volume, as I never need to. At this volume the quality is quite pleasant...which leads me to:Sound Quality: I am quite impressed and satisfied with these speakers. I was uncertian about the fact that they were powered by USB and not a wall outlet, and that they did not have a sub, but these do indeed please my ears.They have great highs, clear and balanced mids, and bass enough to enjoy all sorts of music when kept on modest volume levels.

"The perfect accessory for your Baofeng radio!Most Baofeng radios come with a rechargeable battery only.Now, with using this adapter unit you can power your radio with AA rechargeable batteries.I saw a video online where the guy claims that when using six AA batteries, he can get about three times as much ""life"" out of the radio compared to the stock 1800mAh Li-ion battery that can only be used with the Baofeng charging base.He also pointed out that if you use Tenergy (or similar) batteries, they will fit a little better than just a standard alkaline battery. Rechargeable batteries tend to be a very tiny amount larger in diameter and length. (approx. 1/10th of an inch.)The case is well made and slides onto the radio very easy. The case is very easy to open with a ""press"" tab on the bottom.I really like the way the small HT radio looks and feels with the larger battery adapter on it! Small is cool, but I like the way it fits and feels in my hand. If I want or need ""small"" I can always use the stock battery...or...I am thinking about ordering the Baofeng battery adapter for AAA batteries, too! The AAA battery adapter will not make the radio any larger and it's always a good option to have in case you run out of AA batteries, you can use AAA size. Though, being a smaller battery, they might not last as long as the AA size, but convenient, small & rechargeable either way.You can also find a socket-size car charger for a typical cigarette outlet in most automobiles that will allow you to plug it into the Baofeng charging base to use with charging the stock Baofeng Li-ion battery. A little ""clunky"" to have in your car, but allows you to charge your stock battery on the go!If you have a Baofeng radio...buy this.

"I have absolutely no idea how an internet signal can piggyback on top of electrical wiring without causing all sorts of technological mayhem. But it works, and it works great.I have a WiFi router which sends a great signal to my iPod, but my computer is another story. My home office is in another room than the router, and the WiFi signal has to go through the interference of my wireless phones and my air conditioner. Whenever I'm on the phone or the AC kicks on in the summer, the internet on my computer drops down to worse than 1993-era 56Kbps. Which is simply unacceptable for doing graphic design work from home for clients across the US. And yes, I've tried repositioning the router, getting bigger antennas, adjusting the channel settings, etc.Long story short, I plugged in a couple of these Powerline things, and like magic I was getting reliable high speed internet again with minimal latency (43ms!). No configuration, just plug and play. I bought another set for my Xbox and apparently you can use as many as you want and they all just work together. In case you can't already tell, I'm floored. You can even use other brands together but they have to work at the same speed/protocol.I simply cannot recommend Powerline products enough, especially for people with big houses, WiFi interference, or otherwise sluggish wireless. For hardcore gaming, the latency improvement alone is worth the investment if you can't do wired ethernet.One caveat is that I was not able to get the absolute fastest from my ISP (which I can over ethernet), which I think is due to my house's ancient wiring. My speeds maxed out at about 500KBps down and up. But for me, and I suspect for most people, this is more than enough. It's possible that the more expensive Powerline AV models (faster than 85Mbps) would provide a good amount more speed, but I haven't tried them. I don't need a fancy wireless HD home theater network, I just need to get fast internet from my wall to my computer with limited phone jacks.

"I have the Legend CX which is great, the same as the HCX except the CX does not have the highgrade receiver (less sensitive than the HCX).By the way the CX has slightly longer battery life than the HCX, but the HCX is very good on batts too.Rather than just repeat the other positive reviews (which I agree with), I would like to mention a 4GB micro SD card that I have tested that works with these Gamin Legend CX and HCX: Kingston SDC4/4GB.Amazon sells that card, right now it's under $10.At first the Legends were released when the largest micro SD card was 512 MB, but as larger micro SD cards became available, the Legends would take almost any brand up to 2GB.Next the micro SD format was changed to micro SDHC. Garmin made available a ROM update from their website which allowed *SOME BUT NOT ALL* 4 GB SDHC micro SD cards to work in their handheld GPS.Garmin states that cards over 4 GB will work but only 4GB of data will load on the card, so Garmin states that there is no reason to buy micro SDHC cards over 4 GB for these handhelds. No doubt at some point newer Garmin GPS handhelds will be designed that will take larger cards.So, while you can try various 4GB micro SDHC cards, many or most of which will work, at least some will not work. But the specific card listed above does definately work in Garmin Legend CX and Garmin Legend HCX.It does take hours to transfer 4GB of data from Garmin MapSource or Garmin BaseCamp to the micro SD card inside the handheld, so make sure batteries are fresh enough to last many hours before starting the transfer. Otherwise the handheld might lose power and the hours up to then would be wasted. It took 12 hours for a transfer of 4GB on my Legend CX from BaseCamp. 6 hours for 2GB from MapSource.In other words when you do the final mouseclick to start the transfer the computer will grind away for hours and hours until that one task is done.Also, I'm told on GPS forums that downloading a mapset to the Garmin handheld will replace the old mapset you have previously downloaded with the new mapset. Which sounds like to me that you cannot download some maps and then later add more maps because the old maps will be erased when you download the new.You can of course add new wayoints and routes and so forth without erasing any of the old data, it will be added to the old data, nothing is erased. Just can't add new mapsets to the micro SD card without erasing the mapset you previously added. (Except the original low resolution default mapset which came installed on the handheld will always remain and not be erased, I'm told).",2,2,0.013197368,0.04341052,0.94339204

On the downside, have a lot of spare batteries handy. Battery life is not that great. All in all I'm happy with it.",2,2,0.00045941758,0.00389065,0.9956499

"I want to film my kids, but I never grab the camera.  Is it charged?  Do I have a tape?  And if I film the event I never watch it -- who has another few hours to capture the video and edit?I really have wanted a small, flash based camera with an optical zoom.  Digital Zoom to me is a waste.  I considered the Flip Cameras, the Kodak, and others, but purchased the Sony.  Here are the high points:* Form factor is fantastic!  Comfortable in my hand, easy to operate.  If you have a previous cybershot camera or handycam, you'll recognize the user interface.* Charges up PDQ!* Open the screen, the camera comes on within seconds.* I pull the card, put it in the Memory Stick slot on my computer, and I'm watching video.* PQ is Good -- in the right conditions...* Camera slips in a pocket -- it really is tiny!Low Points --* Really could use image stabilization* I agree with previous users -- indoor videos I have taken have a yellowish hue.  I wonder if this is because more people are using CFL light bulbs -- I have them everywhere I shot indoor video.* Autofocus is a bit slower than my older handycam.  Outdoors, I zoomed in on the neighbors house, and there was a perceptible lag as it focused -- 1 -2 seconds.  This was in Auto Mode.* Built in LED is only useful for ""close-up"" in your face shots.  It did not help in any other scenario.* Uses proprietary Memory Stick media, which is a drawback for some.* Builtin battery -- can't swap when you run out of juice -- you have to rechargeIn the end though, I miss so many events b/c my HandyCam is to big, not charged, can't find a tape, don't want to edit, etc.  My question was is ""decent"" video that I actually DO TAKE superior to the video I DON'T TAKE because of the ""hassle"" of the HandyCam (even if the quality is better).  The answer for me is a resounding yes.  This camera is not perfect, but solves many of the hassle factors that prevent me from taking video -- And it does take GOOD video.Update 2/20 -- After using this camera for several weeks, I can report that the Camera does well with sports when mounted on a tripod.  I'm finding the lack of image stablization to be a big drawback for other types of shooting.  Taking some video of my daughter riding her new bike, the images were shaky, even though I was concentrating on trying to hold still.  This is a good ""second camcorder"", but I no longer consider it a primary.Update 2/25 -- I've decided to return the camera.  I loved it, but I needed a camera that worked well indoors, and ordered a Canon Vixia HF-10.  More pricey, and not a fair comparison.

"I bought this camera refurbished by Kodak from an Amazon seller. I know there are cameras out there with a higher megapixel but I wanted a good zoom. I live in the mountains and we have abundant wildlife. However, they are usually a good distance away, so a good zoom is necessary to get any good pictures. That said, this seems to perform well. The only issue I have is the long time it takes for the zoom to focus. At times it seems to be searching for the subject to focus on and that drives me nuts. I know I miss key shots since wildlife don't usually stand at sttention for you to take their picture !Some have complained about the lens cap that pops off when you turn the camera on. That does not bother me in the least. I'm not crazy about having to manually fold down the flash unit on the top of the camera. That is a stupid feature Kodak should have corrected.I have not used any of the scene modes yet so I can't comment on that aspect of the camera. It's easy to work thank goodness because the inst. manual enclosed is pathetic. I don't use the Easy Share software either. I did order from Amazon a charger with 2 spare batteries and so far I have no complaints about battery life. So for a person who knowingly chose zoom over megapixel, I am pleased. The price difference between a new model and the refurbised model (which looked absolutely brand new & had not a scratch on it) was huge and enabled me to own this camera. For the price, I think it's a good buy. I did buy an extended warranty from Square [...] just in case there is a problem.",2,2,0.000849005,0.014867657,0.9842833
"This portable fold-up stand performs well. I decided on this stand based on the fact it folds away for easy portability.

It is adjustable depending on your viewing angle which is a big plus (especially when combating glare).I find it to be a little less sturdy than I expected. A metallic version would be awesome. Also, when in the portrait mode, there is no way to plug in the 30-pin adapter for the Apple product. I have noticed one can turn the device upside down for many applications, but this if foreign. An elevation would be nice to allow for charging/synchronizing while in portrait mode.I still rate this stand very highly because it does exactly what I need it to do when I need it to do it.

"This monitor has worked perfectly with my Raspberry Pi. I use it for long plane trips. For me, it worked out of the box and I didn't have to mess with the Pi's settings. Also I have it running on this ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008YRG5JQ ) power bank so it is completely portable with no need for a plug outlet.It was simple to do. The supplied power cord plugs into the Red input coming from the LCD. On the other end are 2 wires, red and black. I took a USB cable and cut off one end. When you cut a USB cable there are 4 wires: Red (+), Black (-), White (data +), and Green (data -). Basically you want to only use the Red and Black as you are not using any data here. Solder the Red to the Red and the Black to the Black. Tie off the Green and White and make sure they remain unexposed. Use heat shrink to make it look neat. Then I just plugged the USB end into the EasyAcc 5v 2.1A (or lower even) and you have a portable screen for your Pi. You can actually run both the screen and the Pi from the bank using the 5v 1.3A for the Pi.A few things to note:1. If you intend to use the Yellow Component Video for the LCD, you must NOT have an HDMI connected when you boot up the Pi. Even if you unplug the HDMI it will not switch to the Component if the HDMI was plugged in when you booted.2. There is no blue or fuzzy screen on the LCD nor is there a power button. Meaning that if you do not have a video signal it will remain as though it is not on at all. So even if you supply power to the LCD, it will not turn on until there is video to display.",2,2,0.0005766472,0.0017290277,0.9976943

"My 3 1/2-year-old Dell notebook computer was running out of space on the 120GB Toshiba hard drive that came installed on it.  There were fewer than 5GB remaining.  After contacting Dell's technical support team to determine if my computer's BIOS would recognize the capacity of a larger drive, I learned that 500GB was the largest that my notebook computer would accommodate.  That narrowed down my choices considerably.  Amazon's price for this WD drive was the best I could find.  Most of the reviews for this drive were positive, both on Amazon and on other Websites, so I ordered one along with an external USB SATA hard-drive enclosure.When this WD drive arrived, I mounted it in the enclosure, plugged it into a USB port on my notebook computer and used Acronis True Image Home to clone the data from my existing hard drive to my new drive.  Once the cloning job was complete, I removed the old hard drive from my notebook computer and replaced it with this new one.  I was delighted that my computer instantly recognized the new drive and booted normally.  There were three differences that I immediately noticed:1.  Instead of less than 5GB of free hard-drive space, I now have more than 344GB of free space.2.  My computer now opens and saves files noticably faster.3.  Projected battery life has been extended about 15 minutes from 4:30 to 4:45.In summary, for a much smaller investment than replacing my notebook computer, I was able to considerably extend its useful life and improve its performance too.  After mounting my old Toshiba 120GB hard drive in my external USB enclosure and formatting it, I now have a handy backup drive as well.  My new Western Digital 500GB 2.5"" hard drive has not only met but exceeded my expectations both with its performance and its price.

"When I was starting with photography, I had a 35mm Nikon and three lenses, a 35mm, 85mm and 135mm.  Between those three primes (or a similar combination) you could do pretty much everything.  That was a long, long time ago.  Or was it?Now-days, it seems like you need 4 or 5 or 10 lenses to ""cover"" everything.  Especially if you read the forums, populated with those who prefer to look at charts and read specs as opposed to get out and shoot with what they have.  With all these megapixels at our disposal, what's going on?For many this 50mm 1.8 will be their first prime.  They got an entry-level digital camera and it probably came with a kit lens, probably a variable aperture zoom.  They got a bit into it and decided to upgrade to a zoom with a fixed 2.8, the mythical f/2.8 that allows them to shoot in the dark.Then they started getting more into it, what else is there in digital photography that I'm missing?  Why are these people's photos on the web (flickr, smugmug, whatever) so much more saturated and sharp?  How can I get that level of detail in my photos?  Sooner or later the stumble on the mention of primes.. primes vs zooms.. maybe they read about Leicas.. and they start to question if they really know what they're doing, maybe there's a solution with a better lens yet??And so the hunt starts.. some photographers will find their happy place and others will forever chase technology.There's not much I can add after 100s of other reviews.  This lens is a fabulous little gem from Canon.  The stories about it' sharpness and colors are true.  Let me discuss some of the downsides, and how they play out in practical use.FYI, I've paired this lens up with various bodies, including 20D, 40D, 5D, and a 1D Mark II-N.  It performs well on all.Build Quality: Plastic.  Not sealed.  Rattles a bit.  Loud focusing.  I see none of these as a negative.  They are commensurate with the price point and are honestly quite reliable.  I've used this lens at dozens of weddings, photojournalism assigments, etc.  I've had it caked in sand and salt water with no issues.  Would I bring a $350 1.4 or a $1200 1.2 into those conditions?  Definitely not.  I like having something near-disposable that I can abuse.Related to build quality, this thing is light as a feather.  If you're hiking, climbing, traveling.. pair it up with a newer Rebel T1i or T2i, and you have an awesome little package for stills and video that weighs next to nothing.  Beats the hell out of humping a couple bricks (e.g. 24-70 2.8 on a 40D) for a 3-day hike.  It'll be a bit long in the focal range, but I've never complained.Focusing: It's not USM, so it's not super fast.  But there are ways to make it faster.  For one, manually designating your AF point speeds AF dramatically.  This is true on any lens, from a $90 50mm to a $4500 300mm.  For two, pay attention and anticipate.  Having your lens pre-focused in an area where you suspect something to happen is going to decrease search time by 50%.  Finally, know how your AF works and get your AF point over a high contrast step.  There's a theme here... it's the photographer, not the camera/lens, that makes it happen.  You do your part, and the equipment will do it's part.I do have a gripe about the focus ring.  This is one aspect of the lens that is really lacking.  I'd gladly pay an extra $15-20 for a decent rubberized ring with slightly smoother action.  But, it is what it is.It's also clumsy to attach the hood to this thing, with the adapter piece.  But honestly it looks so silly I usually leave it off.  Haven't noticed any ill-effects from lens flare, just don't shoot into the sun or use your hand.If you've never used a prime, pick this up.  Stocking stuffer for yourself.",2,2,0.008203357,0.030668508,0.9611281

"I have teenagers who are required to have computers for their school, so we go through a lot of computer bags. When Amazon offered this one through the Vine program, I knew it would be put to work immediately, so I grabbed it.Summary: It's a plain, serviceable bag, but nothing special. The main way it distinguishes itself is that it's very lightweight. We'll see how that affects durability after it has hauled computers and books for a while, but certainly the savings of a pound or so over some alternatives is not without merit.The number and size of compartments is pretty standard. The laptop area is sufficiently padded, and is fine for a 15"" laptop, but not for 17"" (we checked). The zipper on that compartment only comes down an inch or two on the side, so you must take the computer in and out through the top. That's actually good design; we've heard of too many cases where a teenager picked up a bag and the computer slid out sideways to crash to the floor. There's another compartment that has a zipper most of the way down the side, clearly designed for books, spiral notebooks, etc.The interior is traffic cone orange. That helps when you're rummaging around inside. I hate black interiors of bags where I can't find the stuff down at the bottom without emptying the whole thing out.The straps are not particularly suited for real backpack wearing, especially for any signficant distance, but we know from experience that mounting the pack on the back is not the daily experience. They're OK for the usual over-the-shoulder carrying.For comparison, the last bag we acquired was theSwissGear SA9259 Backpack (Red), which came up on sale late last year for not too much more than this one. The SwissGear is clearly a superior bag for long wear, and has more pockets, better zippers, better shoulder strap, etc, but it's noticable heavier too. So there are certainly better bags out there - if you are prepared to pay more and carry around some more weight.",2,2,0.0039297915,0.05935575,0.9367144

"I was impressed with the minimal additional weight of the keyboard and case combination, and the soft textured feel of the product, and unlike either of the iPad keyboards I used with my 1st generation iPad or my 3rd generation iPad Retina, the AirBender allows you to adjust the angle that the screen sits at, which is a big positive for me.  The ability to use the iPad in portrait was especially useful in Pages and the newly released Microsoft Word for iPad.  This combination brings the ease of use of my iPad to the more versatile communication capabilities offered by laptop keyboards.I think anyone who does work on the go would benefit from this case, as it adds a needed means of fast data entry to one of the most useful portable computing devices.  As a counselor and student I can see using this keyboard to take notes in Evernote and in a Electronic Medical Records App like MacPractice for iPad.I will mention that one of the detractors to the AIrBender is that the keyboard was less then optimal for someone who touch types above 55wpm, simply because it is a short travel chicklet/island style keyboard with smaller then full size key layout.  However with the exception of carrying a full size bluetooth keyboard there is no solution to that limitation.  In its class, it compares favorably to the Zagg and Apple keyboards I have used in the past, and is superior to the Logitech keyboard, who's space bar always lacked accuracy and lost it's first key in my second day of typing on it.The only measurable complaint I could have with the AirBender Air is the lack of any tension where the hinge attached to the arm.  once or twice before I became accustomed to the very loose action on the hinge the iPad would literally flip over when I tried to open the 'clam-shell' of the closed case.

"For me this is the perfect product.It does what it is supposed to do. It is very easy to use (please read and follow the instructions). It comes with absolutely everything you need.

It comes with all the cables and a nice pouch.Just as most small external hard drives, when used on usb, you only need that one cable.Now let me share with you why having an e-sata hard drive is awesome: BACK UPs.You can back up info on CDS, DVDS, usb flash drives or usb external hard drives. But what about backing up your entire system?I have a 90 Gb installation (not counting media files)-> I can back up music, videos and stuff any other way. But when it comes to backing up your system, e-sata shines.Most Image (as in system image) Back up programs provide a bootable cd/dvd for image back up/restore. It could be a real pain to try to restore from a usb hard drive. And how many DVDs do I need to back up 90 Gb?For the BIOS, an e-Sata drive is just another internal hard drive. It works beautiful for backup as well as restoring an entire system image. And about the fastest thing.I have yet to see an enclosure that beats this one.",2,2,0.000418725,0.001992796,0.9975885
"I bought this last year as a way to catch the 2012 London Olympics. It really was an impulse buy. The price at around $8 and free shipping (with Prime) was actually a better deal than buying locally at Best Buy/Wal-Mart/Target. The antennae box arrived appearing a little over stuffed, as if it had been opened and stuffed in haphazardly. But all the parts were still sealed in plastic bags, and nothing was missing so it wasn't a big deal.The antenna requires some simple assembly - basically screw in the two extendable rods and the loop into the base and you're done. I did have some trouble with the loop - it was pretty difficult to put it in, but with some brute force I eventually got it in.The coax cable is hardwired into the antenna base, and is only about 3 or 4 feet long. This really limited the ability to position the antenna for better reception. Fortunately, I had a 25ft coax cable and a splitter that I used as a make-shift way to extend the antenna's range. This might not be a problem for you folks living in or near big cities and the TV towers, but unfortunately where I live I am about 30 miles out from the nearest tower. Without the extended cable, I was only able to have one watchable channel at any given time. However, with the 25ft coax extension hooked up, I was able to position the antenna around the room and right next to the window. This gives me stable ABC, CBS and NBC in addition to PBS. Big improvement!The signal strength for the major channels are typically two to three bars out of 5 according to my Toshiba TV. But since we're talking digital signals, it's either yes or no, so as long as the picture is stable, I get the full 720P or 1080i signal depending on the station. My only use for TV is for live sports, as I have Netflix and Hulu, and this has served that purpose beautifully! The over-the-air (OTA) signal is comparable, if not better, than cable/satellite, which may use higher compression on their HD channels.Overall, I am satisfied with the performance. I'd give it five stars if not for the short built-in coax cable. It has good durability - I've dropped it accidentally a few times while positioning, and the rods were slightly bent in the process. After gently bending them back, they work just fine and there was no impact on signal strength.",2,2,0.0022988222,0.007813919,0.9898872
"I purchased the Acoustimass 6 (Amazon) in November to replace a Panasonic SC-PT960 home theater system. The Panasonic provided adequate sound but was quite strident sounding. To upgrade my system, I bought the Bose Acoustimass 6 with speaker stands, an Onkyo TX-SR508 (Amazon) receiver (Defective, replacement took 2 days, no charge) and a Samsung BD-C5500 (Amazon) blu-ray disc player which included the apps for TV@Internet (the Pandora radio and Netflix apps are great). Set-up was straight-forward and positive with the color-coded wiring. After adjusting the receiver and fine-tuning the Acoustimass module (bass setting), I was very pleased with the total sound, particularly the ability of the small speakers to create the feeling of ""presence"", especially individual voices and musical instruments. The musical reproduction is excellent. The surround effect with DVDs was seamless and accurate where 'point source' was intended. I would recommend this relatively inexpensive system to anyone.

"Now with all the past complains here, I don't know if AverMedia ""quietly"" updated its product, but here's my experience with this board.Running on a i5 Haswell 2.8 ghz UEFI bios, everything seems to work. The only hiccup I got was WMC had problem with one of my TV channel even though it detected 5-bars. After some tinkering I fixed it by giving WMC a different zip code, so nothing wrong with the hardware but am guessing Media Center downloads Internet-based info to set things up and the database for my original zip code is wrong (no obvious way to manually review). Another minor thing, I moved the board to another PCIe and WMC got confused but all I had to do was to re-configure WMC.  So both problems had to do with WMC being dumb and nothing to do with the A188 hardware.WMC records to .WTV at 6GB per hour of 1080p program by default.

"After acquiring a new treadmill, I got some bluetooth wireless headphones so I could watch movies on my iPhone without dangling cords to hear the audio, but frankly, they aren't comfortable. Thanks to the frame of the satellite speakers, I was able to mount them with cable ties onto my treadmill. The subwoofer on the ground and the speakers plugged into my iPhone, I was able to hear the audio when playing music and while watching a movie on my iPhone. Despite turning the audio up nearly all the way so I could hear over my panting, the foot falls on the treadmill and just the noisy sound of the treadmill motor, I heard no distortion or rattle - nice full sound. I stopped the treadmill to get some water and left the movie running and as loud as it was (and no longer competing w/ the sound of me or the treadmill), it sounded great.Usually, if you want good sound out of speakers with a subwoofer, you're looking at spending a minimum of $100 for a decent sound - but Altec Lansing has make a speaker system that sounds a lot better than my JBL Duets (without a subwoofer), and is louder, for the same price as the popular 2-speaker system. The subwoofer is fairly small, so it takes up little space.These sound great, whether used for a computer, iPod, iPhone or in AirTunes, and are very reasonably priced.

"My application is providing WiFi connectivity to an ancient desktop that I needed to move to a room without wired Ethernet access.  This product (like other Netgear products I've used) is truly Plug-N-Play.  Highlights:(1) The unit can be powered via a 120 VAC supply or via a USB port.  Both the supply and the USB cable are included.(2) The provided Ethernet cable and USB cable are ~35"" long, which permits you to place the adapter in a position with good WiFi reception.  This is particularly important if the PC or other unit is located underneath a desk or in a cabinet.(3) The setup is truly Plug-N-Play.  No drivers need to be loaded in advance.  Once you connect the adapter, a browser window opens up. Instructions guide you step-by-step through the configuration process.  Only unexpected behavior:  I needed to reboot the PC before the WiFi connection kicked in.  There was no mention in the instructions that a reboot would be needed.  So, if your unit hangs after installation, reboot the unit before you decide to return the adapter.(4) The ""mounting kit"" is a strip of Velcro.  I would not recommend using it by itself.  The adapter does get warm, with most of the heat dissipated through the back, which is where the Velcro strip would go.  There are four shallow rubber bumps on the back to provide some clearance for airflow.  If you do need to stick the unit against a flat surface, I would provide additional spacers to provide a 1/4"" or more clearance.  Mine is resting on the curved top of my PC, so there is sufficient clearance.(5) This adapter supports 802.11 n, which has a higher speed than 802.11 g.  Right now I'm using it with a standard 802.11 g WiFi router.  I've not noticed any speed drop relative to a wired Ethernet connection.(6) My only negative comment is that this adapter is pricey.

Not sure if there is enough draw for that to be necessary but no light dimming.  I'm really pleased with this amp and for its size it's pretty remarkable.  Terminals don't fit zero gauge ring terminals but with a little tweaking you can get it to work.  Better than the alpine m1000 for a little cheaper.,2,2,0.00029618118,0.0014054759,0.99829835
"After receiving the Kandle by Ozeri II, I can now read my Kindlea anywhere.  I like to read in the car while traveling and at night in bed.  The Kandle allows me to do this without disturbing my husband and it puts out just the right amount of light.  It arrived promptly and securely in the mail.  I am now a Happy Reader!",2,2,0.00038122217,0.00077743776,0.99884135
"I like my Mac keyboard form factor but I keep making mistakes using that keyboard (big guy - big fingers).  To make a long story short, this Logitech 810 keyboard is just what I hoped it would be.  The Mac keyboard is too sensitive for me .. and .. for some reason, with it, my fingers keep hitting the wrong keys (I suspect it has to do with key shape).  For me, the keys on this 810 keyboard have just the right amount of travel (somewhat more than with my Mac keyboard) and the resistance to my finger pressure is just right (It takes more than just the slight touch that gives me problems on the Mac keyboard).  Also, on the Logitech 810, the keys have rounded corners rather than square and there's a concaveness to these keys that is lacking on the Mac keyboard.  Finally, the bumps on the f and j keys on this 810 are sufficiently pronounced to where I always know just where my fingers are (I had problems in that respect with the Mac keyboard).  The Mac keyboard is every bit as good as the rave revues say it is, but it needs a typist that has a sensitive touch, that keyboard is not so good for big clumsy guys like me.I'm writing this because I had trouble eking out this specific kind of information from all the reviews I read.  But don't get me wrong, it was those reviews that got me to spend my money on this.  By the way, Logitech packaged this keyboard in the same manner that Apple packages its products.  Not only that, the look and feel of this keyboard would almost make you believe that it was made by Apple. Good job Logitech - Impressive!",2,2,0.016308395,0.16884717,0.8148444
"Licensing fees are expensive, so I wondered if the quality of the headphones would be secondary to the Star Wars collectible aspect of this package but was pleasantly surprised by their performance. The bass is heavy but not at all overpowering. The highs and mid-range are still sharp and crisp. After listening for several hours to a variety of music like Foo Fighters, Joe Bonamassa, Beth Hart, Gary Clark, Jr., Eric Clapton, Andrea Bocelli and Sly and the Family Stone, I heard background instruments that previously went unnoticed - even heard quiet talking at the beginning of a favorite song that I never heard before (Bonamassa's I Don't Believe.)The headphones are perfectly comfortable with sufficiently cushy leather on-ear pieces and plenty of adjustment options in the head band. Although not noise cancelling they passively suppress surrounding sounds sufficiently so the music can be the focus without losing all connection with the outside world.  While listening, no one nearby can hear the music, so others remain undisturbed.Easy to use - with my iPod I could use the audio cable's microphone control to skip a song, go back to a song or pause the play. There is no volume control - that needs to be adjusted with the phone or other listening device in use. These controls did not work when plugged into my PC. And, although the plug end that goes into the listening device is at a 90 degree angle, its housing is slim enough that when plugged in, although a snug fit, my iPod can also be plugged into its charger, something not always possible with other brands.Clearly these are designed for Star Wars collectors, not someone just looking for a pair of headphones, and as far as that goes, this is a nice package with a highly styled cardboard sleeve that slides off a sturdy bright blue box (Stormtroopers edition) which unfolds open revealing an egg shaped black fabric covered hard shell 8 by 6 by 4 inch zippered Star Wars embossed case with white piping. The headphones are folded within, along with the built-in microphone audio cable with 3.5mm plugs. The instruction manual is tucked under the edge of the box and there is a holder for the certificate of authenticity, poster, stickers, etc. The branded soft cloth for keeping the headphones clean is separately bagged in the main compartment. I am seriously impressed with the quality of this pair of headphones and the attractiveness of the presentation.",2,2,0.0006768597,0.0034244303,0.99589866
"I bought this at COMPUSA today. The monitor's image looked very sharp. With fine texts due to its 0.26mm small dot pitch. The only problem I found is somehow the bottom part of the screen is slightly brighter, which wouldn't be a problem unless you are so picky. The base also is not not tall or bulky so the screen is not much higher than my old 15&quot;, so I don't need to jack up my chair in order to have my eye looking down toward the screen.  All in all, this one beats the more expensive Samsung SyncMaster 770 TFT (which I had and sold) hands down.",2,2,0.0006471584,0.0023744174,0.9969785
"I have been very happy with my Garmin GPS's and was surprised how well the TomTom XL 350 compares.  Here is a brief comparison based on my use of Garmin Nuvi 680, 350, 205, and 255w:TomTom 350 XL Pros+ TomTom's predictive/suggested names appear as you type (below where you type so not intrusive) for much quicker and easier entry of destination+ Offered in T/M/TM versions which include lifetime Traffic and/or Map updates at extremely reasonable prices.+ Intuitive menu with many selections to help you find what you need without resorting to instructions or trial and error+ Ability to correct maps and download community corrections+ Ultra simple setup and very easy to useTomTom Cons- Garmin presents a more polished main screen with much less clutter-  Garmin units  offer more settings (i.e. GPS will use speeds you enter for different types of roads)- TomTom is a little slower, but not to the point where it would matter to most people- I couldn't find the volume control except to mute the TomTom- Most new Garmins  display speed limit for most roads.- Included windshield mount is harder to use than Garmin's; unit detaches easily from mount while you are trying to adjust it.Overall, I feel both companies make excellent GPS devices that are offered at competitive prices.  The 350 XL is not as polished in some areas as the Garmin devices I've owned.  It also lacks some settings that could be important to you.  However, the TomTom excels at ease of use and could be the better choice if you are looking to avoid instructions.",2,2,0.001670275,0.005805709,0.99252397

The sound is good and connects via BT very well. Easy to operate. Remember it is a small speaker - so don't expect booming sound. But it is above your run of the mill computer speakers. I recommend it.,2,2,0.00029747418,0.0031937244,0.9965088
"Purchased in May, 2007, have used the Garmin Nuvi 680 for short and long trips, near home and across the country.  It is an expensive, top-of-the-line GPS, but mostly justifies this cost with its slew of helpful features.Production Quality:The Screen is bright, colorful and crisp.  It's large touch screen is easy to view when driving and even automatically switches to display differently for night and day.  The touch screen is accurate, though users with big fingers may hit a couple wrong keys on the touch keyboard, especially when the car is moving.  Menus are easy to navigate and most items appear in the logical, intuitive place.  The included mount works well, but has fallen off a few times.  There are many voices to select from and all sound clear and easy to understand.  The leather case included is nice for stowing or carrying the GPS without worry of scratching.  Overall, very polished product with little oversight.Features:The Nuvi 680 is loaded with features.  Some features are common to most GPS - Points of Interest Database, travel related software tools, multiple stops en route, option to take a detour at any time, preview of route, zooming in/out & changing view of map.  I cannot compare to other devices, but these features all work quite well.  Though the POI database can be slow to find a particular place by spelling and occasionally a place is found in an incorrect sub-category.  Anyway, the main feature that sets this GPS apart is the MSN Direct Service...MSN Direct - Traffic:Traffic reporting is the big draw here above other models.  However, it can take 15 minutes or longer (around 20-25% of the time not working at all) for the traffic information to update when you plug in the GPS.  If you keep in plugged into your car, often your wait time will be less, but you will still occassionally be left in the dark.  When traffic reporting is functioning, you will get a semi-realistic estimate of the time delay and acess to brief details regarding all delays in the area.  It's tough to say for sure, but I believe the rerouting usually saved me a good 10-30 minutes at least half a dozen times.  Yet, it seems like there were as many times or more where I should have been rerouted and was not.  Hopefully the firmware update I just received will fix these issues.  One simple suggestion I'd have is to let the user know when they've been automatically rerouted and to show both routes and ETA's on the map screen.To illustrate - On a normally 3 hour trip we hit 2 hours of traffic, while 30 minutes were predicted by MSN and only after an hour into the trip (but before the traffic jam).  We were rerouted around some of the traffic (maybe 30 minutes time saved), but if the correct delay had been predicted, we probably would have been shown a detour shaving off even more time.  So while certainly better than a regular GPS, left some room for improvement.MSN Direct - Weather, Gas, Movies:Unlike traffic reporting, Weather, Gas and Movies information is useful even if it is several hours or even a day or two old.  Usually gas prices are correct or within a few cents.  Movie showtimes I haven't used much, but seem correct.  The weather, I've tried the most, and is probably 90% accurate, maybe more.  These features can be pretty helpful, though I rarely drive out of the way for gas.Ease of Use:The startup time (to acquire satelites) is a fairly quick, almost always under 5 minutes, usually under 2 minutes.  The route calculation is even faster, almost always under 1 minute, usually under 20 seconds.  GPS is highly accurate, despite my regular driving through crowded criss-crossing streets.  Once in a while, it may take a few seconds for the GPS to register a turn, but hasn't caused me any problems.  Recalculating of route is very quick when you miss a turn, enough to make the next turn.  Guidance through directions are easy to pay attention to, with well placed reminders and clear graphical presentation when there are many places to turn off or road splits.  It certainly beats mapquest!Overall:I'm glad I bought this GPS.  While I would highly recommend it, I believe for some, the much cheaper Nuvi 350 is a better buy.  The traffic reporting is currently hit or miss and so you may find yourself listening to the radio for traffic anyway.  However, if you can't stand traffic and are planning to use this for many years to come, you'll eventually get your money's worth.  And hopefully some time in the future the firmware will be optimized and MSN Direct will have a comprehensive reporting system.",2,2,0.003342272,0.03260477,0.96405303
